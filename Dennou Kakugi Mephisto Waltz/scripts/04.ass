◆ Sharing the controls!?
Hey,
Are you serious, Sakuraba? There's no way you can play like that.
He's right. We won't ev—
{Remove the ★ text}

Why don't you try us, Takagi?
All right, then...
If I win, you have to buy me dinner.
Yeah,
whatever.
Yes!!
Just go with your gut. I'll handle the rest.

Let's do this!
Yeah!!

I ain't pullin' any stops!

Fuck!! I can't hit him at all!

Calm down, Takagi!
He's just running around!
Shut up, I know!! I'll make an opening and then—

What!?

You're kidding...

I just lost to two people sharing the controls...
I guess this is another page for the Legend of Sakuraba.
Did anyone film that?
You should have a pretty good idea of how to play Kuroumaru after that.
Huh?
N-no, I wasn't thinking about that at all.
Ah, fine.
I'll play Kuroumaru for a bit then. Watch.

It won't be much fun
if you don't level up at least a bit by Friday.

U-Umm...
Were you serious when you said you wanted to play me this Friday?
Of course. You better train up as much as you can before then.
W-Why me, though?
I'm really not that Morimiya.
I said I know. Your play style reminds me of him a bit, though.
H-how!?

Well, I do want to play against Morimiya,
But he's an online player.
Why don't you play online?

There's lag
when you play online.
Lag?
※Lag refers to the connection speed. When playing online, the two computers need to be able to send information back and forth, and this exchange takes time. Due to this, there is often some amount of delay.
{※ is a Japanese asterisk}
That's when the connection is bad, right? I've seen plenty of videos of people playing online.
It looked like they were able to play just fine.
Fran, do you know how fast light moves?

I'm talking about the speed of light.
It's 300 kilometers per second.
It's the same for electricity. 300 kilometers per second is the highest speed at which data can travel.
Right...
You know how UA3 runs at 60 FPS?
Wait, you don't?
In short, a "frame" is the smallest unit of time in the game.
One frame is 1/60th of a second.
Even if you can react to your opponent's movements, a difference of 1/60th of a second may cause your character to move too late.

It's 2500 kilometers from one end of Japan to the other.
A round trip would be 5000 kilometers.
Even at the speed of light, this journey would take time.
It would take 1/60th of a second - one frame.
In practice, it has to go through the server so it's even slower.
No matter what you do, there will always be some delay when you play online. Even a moment of delay is intolerable.
You might miss the timing to make your input,
Or the server may not even register your input.
You could get hit by a critical art.
You get it?

Our world moves in increments of 1/60th of a second.
The speed of light is too slow for us.
