The fight is over.
So what happened in the end?

Did you win that match you were talking about?
Of course not. I managed to steal a game but I got demolished 7-1.

I lost.
There was so much more I could have done.
I guess I still suck.
Fran?

Don't tell me you're going to keep playing that game?
H-Huh? Uhh... Y-Yeah, just a bit....
I'm starting to enjoy it, after all...
Oh yeah...? I can't believe you're into fighting games...

Thanks, Aya.
For what?
All I did was tell you where the arcade was.

You did more than that.
You're the real Morimiya, aren't you? {OMGGGG}

Wh-What?
What are you talking about?
Morimiya's videos came up in the recommendations on the video site on my iPad.
That's how I found out about the game.
But I'd never watched videos about fighting games until that point.
Who else could watch fightin game videos on my iPad?
It was you, wasn't it? I lent it to you when you were cooking.

N-No... Umm...
And that time we went to the arcade, you knew straight away that the fighting games were in the basement.
If you really didn't play, you wouldn't know sometihng like that, would you?
Yeah, b-but...
And more than anything,
Kuroumaru's persona looked exactly like me.
Why is that?
They would have needed multiple different scans of my face.
You're the only one who would be able to do that.

...!
Aya!!
U-Um...
I'm not mad or anything...
I wanted to say thank you.
It's all thanks to you.
If it weren't for you, I never would have discovered UA3.

That's right! It was me! The online wonder Morimiya is me!
I'm Morimiya!
I've been playing for 8 years! I've also uploaded heaps of videos!

You've been playing for 8 years? I had no idea...
Wait, Aya!
Sakuraba once told me that I resemble Morimiya.
Now I feel like I know why.
She's always been by my side ever since I was little.

I seriously can't believe you would start playing fighting games!
And you even went and played a FT7 with the Sakuraba Taiga!
Oh my god!
I was holding it in all this time! I wanted to say I'd teach you— no, that I'd play for you!
Why are you the one feeling so dejected?!
S-Sorry... Why were you keeping it a secret, though?
It's just... Kind of not girly!
I don't get it...

Wouldn't it have been better to pick a different name if you were trying to hide it?
Why would you use my last name?
U-Uh... Well...
I wanted to have the same last name as you!!
It's always been my dream!

Huh? Why? It's nothing special.
I guess it's a bit uncommon? {lmfao omg this guy}
!!? {omg her face wwwww}
I can't believe you!!
Did you seriously not get what I just said?!
You get upset over the dumbest things but you're so slow when it matters!
I'm sorry!! Why are you so upset?
Aargh!! You hurt my feelings, I'm done being nice! I'm going to put your gameplay through the wringer!
I watched your whole match today from the stairs, you suck! You always wake up with a mid kick! It got outspaced and punished every time!
You need to use your other wakeup options!
You use unblockables way too much as well! You don't use unblockables when your opponent is just throwing light kicks! The only decent thing I saw was your combo, but you shouldn't have started the combo with that punch!

You're going to make a new account?
Yeah, it would be confusing to have the same name as you.
Wouldn't it be better for me to change my account name then?
You're the real Morimiya, after all.
No, I'll do it.
Morimiya is famous, you'd confuse everyone if you changed your username.
I suppose that's true...

What will you call your ne account, then?
I already have one in mind.
You're really going with this?
It doesn't bring back any bad memories?
Yeah, this is what I want.

I couldn't finish my Mephisto Waltz that day,
but I'll start playing it again.
All right, let's buy a customization for Kuroumaru!
There's this really cute one that would look great on you!
◆ A new chapter will begin next time!
I don't want it...
