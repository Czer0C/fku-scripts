Chapter 6

Last ditch attack!

Damn...
Guess there's nothing he can do.

Looks like he was a beginner after all.
How many times is he going to fall for that setup?
He's up against Sakuraba, you know. He never had a chance.
Why is Sakuraba playing with this kid anyway?

This is way too one-sided.
He hasn't even won a single round.
I can see that!
There's no way I would've stood a chance.

This is getting ridiculous.
Why am I here? Why am I even playing this game?
The piano was all I had, and I lost it.
Now I'm here playing fighting games of all things?
Sakuraba's on match point...

It's no surprise it would end up like this. I only started playing last week.
I can't compete with the world champion.
Sakuraba overestimated me.
I'm just trying to escape from reality.
I envy you, Kuroumaru.
We look alike, but I can't even move my fingers properly.
Yet you can fly around freely and enjoy your fights.
Sorry. I'm not good enough to set you free.

Even watching this is making me sad.
Yo Fran! Open your eyes, it's about to start!
He's gonna get you, Fran!
I can tell just by the sounds.
Nape.
Left flank.
Right arm.
Stomach
Chin.
Neck.
My Kuroumaru is getting decimated...

All that was left was the sound of my heartbeat.
Sound...
Thump
Thump

Sound...?

What the hell are you doing Fran?
It's over if you lose the next round!
Are you giving up already?
Fran...?

I've always been able to hear the sounds.
That's one thing I haven't lost yet.
Hey, what's up with him?
Is he serious?
What is he thinking?
His eyes are closed...

He knocked him down!
He stopped Sakuraba's assault!
He did that with his eyes closed?
How did he do that?

I can hear him... He's crouching three paces ahead!

N-No way...
He did the Morimiya Special?
I thought only Morimiya could do that combo!
Was he actually the real Morimiya all along?
Wait, he's not done!
That's right.
This isn't the Morimiya Special.
This is my combo. We're playing to my rhythm and my beat.
This is my Mephisto Waltz.

...!
Thank God...
Now I can fight him...
For just a little bit longer...
