Aya~
Hm?
Aya, do you know if there's a big arcade around here?
Arcade?
You didn't even come to school today but you're going to go to the arcade?
It's not like that.. Well it is, but...
Umm...

Actually,
Fran, were you ever the type to play games?
You haven't even been to an arcade before, right? Do you know what they're like?
Not really... Do you go to arcades a lot?
I go to use the photo booths sometimes, I guess...
Oh, okay.
Sorry...
I'll go find one myself.
There's a game I want to try.
I'll-
I'll go with you!
Just in case!

So, what kind of game did you want to try?
Uh, what was it...?
It's called Unlimited Arts 3 (UA3).
{Sign: Morimiya Special}
Since when were you into fighting games!?

{Text next to his face: So this is an arcade...}
Fran, let's go take a photo together!
Huuhh..?

I didn't come here for this, you know...
Come on, it won't take long!
Let's go!

Fran!
Over here!
You still want to take more photos...?
No, look.
It looks like the fighting games are in the basement.
I'm not too good with this kind of atmosphere, with people playing all seriously, so I'll be playing the crane games all right?
Huh?
Y-yeah...

Wow...

Ah, I found it. This is the game!

Aah!
Ah, ah...
{Speech bubble SFX: sit}

Oh, sorry.
Ouch...
Are you playing?
Go ahead!
Huh?
Err...
Umm...
Unlimited Arts Three!

Uhh...
Character Select!
He's here! It's this character! Wait...
{Sign (char name): Kuroumaru}
He doesn't look like me...?
Sign: Create a Player Card? Y/N
Huh? Umm... Yes...
Please enter your name.
Huh? Umm... M-o-r-i-m-i-y-a...
Would you like to scan your persona?
Sign: Would you like to scan your persona? Y/N
Uhh...

Scanning your persona.
Ah, this is it!
Wow, it uses the player's face...
Wait...
This is the first time I've played this game, so how was there video footage?

Huh?
Is-
Is-
Is th-
Is that Morimiya!?
Aah!
Huh? What?
Morimiya?
Really?
I thought he only played online!
It's really him! Morimiya Kuroumaru!
Look at his face!
You're right, it's exactly the same!
So his persona was his own face?
I was sure it was from a drawing or something!
Is it a girl?
It's obviously a guy.
Is he a Westerner?
Is he half-Japanese?

Oh man, I didn't think I'd ever be able to see Morimiya play right in front of my eyes.
Hey,
We should call Sakuraba.
Yeah, you're right. He really wanted to play against Morimiya.
{Sign next to his face: I didn't realize it was you before!}
Hey!
Hey, hey! You're Morimiya, right?
Huh? Uhh... Err...
Well, my name is Francois Morimiya... But I'm definitely not the Morimiya from the video that these people are talking about...
I didn't realize he was this famous...
Sorry, you must have the wrong person.
Huh? That can't be...
If he says it's not him then just leave him be. He has been hiding his identity all of this time, after all.

That has to be Morimiya.
Trying to hide it doesn't do much. He's always playing Kuroumaru as well...
I'm so excited! Getting to see Morimiya play in person!
I've always looked up to him and chose Kuroumaru as well, but I can't win at all, hahaha...
Morimiya's play is so captivating!
Umm...! You really have the wrong person!
This is the first time I've tried playing this game...
You don't need to keep up the charade.
Why did you suddenly decide to come to the arcade?
Were you planning to compete in a tournament or something?
If they see me play, they'll believe me, right...?

He won!
Morimiya won!
That wasn't really anything to get excited over, was it...?
Someone challenge him, quick!
It's your chance to fight Morimiya in the arcade!
Calm down, Morimiya always practices his combos against the CPU before playing.
I can't wait to see that!
I need to see his hands as he does his combos!!

There's a lot of buttons... What happens when I press this one?
Oh!
He's only using standing normals!
Morimiya is so good!

He won the first CPU fight using only the buttons!
He's hiding his strategies, huh?
He's still amazing either way!
I was just pressing the buttons!
Sakuraba...

Sakuraba?
Sakuraba's here?
I called him earlier and told him Morimiya's here.
Sakuraba's actually here!
Really!?

Who's this...?

Sakuraba vs Morimiya!
It's finally happening!
Sakuraba doesn't play online, after all.
I didn't think I'd ever get to see him play against Morimiya, who only plays online.
Someone film it! This is a historical moment!
Excuse me, who is that person? Why does he want to play against me?
Huh?
You don't know who Sakuraba is?
You play UA3 and don't know who Sakuraba is...?
Hey guys, isn't Morimiya just trying to provoke him?

He's saying that Sakuraba isn't even worth knowing?
Of course Morimiya would say that!
He's on a completely different level!
Th-that's not it!!
I'm not Morimiya and I really don't know who Sakuraba is!
There's no way you can't know him, he's last year's world champion.
Huh?
Sakuraba Taiga, the Lightning Emperor. He's been known for being a prodigy since UA1.
He destroyed the national qualifiers and went onto the UA3 world championship.
He's the first to have won consecutive championships - a living legend.

Haah... {Sighing}
Morimiya...?
What was that?
He wasn't able to do anything at all...
Surely after seeing this, they'll believe that I'm not that Morimiya...

W-wow!
Wow Morimiya!
He threw the first round so he could analyze Sakuraba's movements!
Why does it keep coming to this!?
What, it's still going!?
I wish it would just end...

Ugh...
Y-you're not Morimiya!
That's what I've been saying this whole time!
So he's not Morimiya?
A fake?
For real...?
Even though he had that persona?
Where do you think you're going?

You've still got some fight left in you. You can still keep playing. Sit back down.
Umm.. I'm not the Morimiya you're thinking off. You have the wrong person!
I can see that you're not Morimiya.
Th-
Then-

You're stronger than Morimiya.
Huh?
H-how can you say that?
Today was the first time I played this game! I'm not good at all!
You're not the one who gets to decide whether you're good or bad.
I am!!
I don't understand...

Don't worry about the money, I'll pay. We're playing another game.
He's doing it again...
Sakuraba's paying for his opponent's games!
Is this what I've heard about him paying for his opponents' games when he really wants to play them?
Yeah...
He's too nice.
I guess he's gonna have to play him.
Umm... I... Sorry, I need to leave.
{Speech bubble sfx: tongue click}
All right, fine, I get it.
We're going to play 3 games.
Why is it 3 now!?

You're not the one who gets to decide when you're going home.
I am!!
It should be me!!
Fran?
Fran?
What are you doing?

What do you think you're doing to Fran?
Come on, Fran, we're going home.
Y-yeah...

Are you running?
That's right!
I'll wait a week for you.
Be here next Friday. We'll play again.
{Sign: Will he accept the challenge?}
