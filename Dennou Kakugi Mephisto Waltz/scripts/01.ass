No longer playing due to rare condition.
Morimiya Francois: Prodigy Pianist | Revival Impossible
Musical Weekly
Morimiya Francois' real medical condition
{Can't see shit on the other side of the page}
{Same page as in the previous panel}
The ring finger and pinky finger on his left hand have lost all movement.
I'm not sure what caused this...
For the time being, he should be allowed to rest.
Genius Boy Pian-
Recovery Impossible-
I can't believe this happened to the successor of such a brilliant pianist...
We've lost such a great talent...
I'm sure his father up in Heaven is also crying...

Fran... Why... Why...
I'm sorry, mother.
I can't...
Play the piano any more...
I have to play the rest...
It was my...
Mephisto Waltz...

{Page 8}
{SFX: Wheeze}
{SFX: Haah, haah, haah {heavy breathing}}
It's already gotten this late...
I need to do my piano practice...

Oh, right...
I can't...
Play the piano any more.
I don't have to play any more...

I don't know what I should be doing now that I can't play the piano.

The unfinished Mephisto Waltz...
The musician inside of me has died.
{SFX: Door opening}
Fran, are you home?


Hm? Fran?
Mmmm.....
Mm... {SFX: Plop}
Oh! {SFX: Flinch}
So you were here.
You skipped school again today, didn't you!?
I'm s-sorry, Aya...

Her name is Mizuki Ayane. {Sfx: sigh}
She lives next door. We've been friends since we were young.
I bet you skipped lunch and slept all day as well, too.
Where's your mum?
Mother is probably...
I think she's visiting universities to find doctors again...
Hm, okay.
We can't really count on her, huh.
I guess I'll make dinner, then. {SFX: Slip}

I need to look at the recipe so I'm going to borrow your tablet, ok?
When I go on tour to play in concerts, no one stays at home so we ask Aya to do all of the household chores. She's always been much better than me at them.
You're really short, Fran! You need to eat more!
I was born short...

Burp.
{SFX: Washing dishes}
Hey, Fran...
Huh?
You need to brush your teeth!
{Small text: Open wider~}
I can do it myself!
You need to have a wash!
I said I'll do it myself! {SFX: rustle}
I was going to wash later!
{SFX: Drip}

Here you go, Fran.
Th-thanks...
{SFX: blowing}
{SFX: grab}
Hey, you need to dry off properly or you'll catch a cold!
{SFX: flinch}
Aya, I'll do it mys- {SFX: rub, rub, rub}
Shut up and stay still!
{SFX: grumble}
Oh yeah, I was wondering...
I saw a bunch of CDs and sheet music in the trash outside... Are you really throwing them out?

... Yeah...
I don't need them any more. Listening to myself play the piano is just painful...
{SFX: slip}
Even up to this day, I still love your playing.
So hearing you say something like that... It makes me a bit sad...

Sorry.
Don't apologize! {SFX: Ahaha...}
Wait!
Does this mean you're going back to being a normal 15 year old?
{SFX: Slap}
H-huh?
Well, I guess...
Then you should come to school!
{SFX: Mumble}
You haven't come since the entrance ceremony!
I'm sorry.
People keep asking me about my piano career or my fingers and stuff and it's been getting really tiring...

Just when I thought we could have an ordinary high school life together...
{SFX: Disappointed sigh}
Would you consider putting him in a different environment?
A normal high school, instead of a music college prep school.
I'd be completely lost if I were put into a normal high school after being so immersed in music.
Make sure to keep warm when you go to sleep!
I get it already!
What do I need to do to live a normal lifestyle?
Without the piano, I don't even know how to laugh or cry.

{SFX: Meow, meow}
{YT vid title: Playing cats are cute}
For the rest of my life,
I could just lie around and watch cat videos all day.
{SFX: slide, slide}
Hm?

{YT vid title: Morimiya Special}
Why am I in this video?

{SFX: hit sound?}

{SFX: slip}

{SFX: crack}
{SFX: huff}
{SFX: wince}

{SFX: hit}

{SFX: punch}

{SFX: hitting the fence}

fuck let's just leave all of the sfx untranslated, it makes no sense in english anyway and tsing it will look shit

{page 30}
This is a game?
Why am I... No, why is there a character that looks exactly like me?
M-o-r-i-m-i-y-a... Morimiya?
Even his name is the same as mine... What's going on?
◆Will the encounter with this game change his life?
Dennou Kakugi Mephisto Waltz: Chapter 1, End.
