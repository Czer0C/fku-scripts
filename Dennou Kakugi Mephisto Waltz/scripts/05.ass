Friday
The day of the match
*click*
Ah.
Fran?
You have a match to play at the arcade?
So that's what you were doing. 
{sfx: haaah... (how do you sigh in english)}
I was wondering why you were going out every night.

...
You're playing fighting games because you can't play the piano any more? That makes no sense!
Huh? No... Uhh...
Am I just trying to avoid facing reality?
No...
The guys there are teaching me properly!
And Sakuraba really looks like he wants to play me! That's why... Uhh...
Haahh...

You don't even come to school and you still have the nerve to go to the arcade every day?
Uhh... U-Umm...
I'm coming with you! If I let you keep this up, you're definitely going to become a delinquent!{need a better word here}
I knew this was going to happen...

...

!!?

He's here!
Is he really a beginner?{noob?}
Why is he playing Sakuraba?
Isn't that a girl?

Despite the appearance, he is a guy.
Good luck!
You're gonna get destroyed but at least try to get a hit on him!

W-Wow
This looks like a pretty big deal...
I don't really know what's going on... Uhh...
G-Good luck!!
Heeey!
Ugh...
Yo, come here!
Hey, Fran!
Hello Takagi!
Where's Sakuraba?

Oh, him?
He's probably—

... {newline}The Yamanote Line is too slow for us.
You slept in, didn't you?!
You still have bed hair!
Don't blame the train!!
You didn't chicken out, huh?
Uhh... Yeah... I did say I would come...

You're quite something, coming here every day this past week to practice.
If I'd never played before and some unreasonable guy suddenly demanded to play a match with me next week,
I'd be so creeped out I would never come back to the arcade.
He's saying this after I showed up for the match?
Wait, so he is aware that he's being unreasonable...

Even I don't really know why I came here today.
But I feel like I'll understand once we play.
Okay, Fran.
We're going to play a first to seven.
O-Okay!
Ft7, huh...
It's gonna be a long set.
Damn, Sakuraba's getting all serious!
Getting serious against a beginner?

He's going for an extended combo right from the beginning!?
Has he really been playing for only a week?
I need to force my wake-up game and keep chipping away at him if I want any chance of winning!

Keep attacking...
Keep attacking...
Keep attacking!
{sfx: Whoa!!!}

He stopped me!
No,
I knew he would.
I have to accept the risk and keep attacking!
Attain victory!!
