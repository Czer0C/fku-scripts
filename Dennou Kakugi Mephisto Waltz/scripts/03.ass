Haah... {Sighing}
I'm home...
Oh, Mother... I didn't know you were back.
Oh, Fran... I consulted a counselling doctor today.
There's a doctor in America famous for treating patients with nerve problems.
One of his rehabilitation procedures might help you, so let's try that next week.

I'll make sure your fingers heal, Fran.
You're the only one in the world
who can play the piano like he did.

Play the piano like Father...
Mother, I'm sorry.
I'm done with music.

Huh?
Where's my phone?
I left it at the arcade yesterday!!

Hey, fake Morimiya!
Umm... Umm....
Err... Uhh...
Oh,
You're looking for your phone, right? I'll get the staff for you.

Ah,
You were here yesterday! I picked this up for you!
Haah. {Sigh of relief}
I heard you were going to play Sakuraba next week.
I can't wait!
Since you came all the way here, you're gonna play for a bit, right?
Huh?
Uh, no, I just came to pick up my phone...
It's really impressive, you know? To be challenged by Sakuraba even though you're just a beginner.
Umm...
{Remove text on the right}

Th-there must have been s-some kind of mistake...
Hey,
It's me. Where are you? Hey, do you remember the fake Morimiya that was here yesterday? He's at Gambit right now. {Name of the arcade, you see it a few pages prior}
Yeah, that's right.
I'm serious! Hurry up and come. You were the one that picked up his card, right?
Hey, we're over here!
Sup!

You forgot this as well.
Ah, th-thanks.
I can't bring myself to tell him I left it on purpose.
Man, are you sure you're not an acquaintance of Morimiya?
His character looks exactly like you.
I don't know him. I only saw him in a video.
Ah, so he's seen Morimiya's videos.
It's no surprise he wanted to play after seeing those.
So that's why you set you picked "Morimiya" as your handle?
Morimiya is a really famous online player.
There are some ridiculously hard combos in the game, and Morimiya is the only one in the world who can do them.
That's why they get called "Morimiya Specials".
Though he never plays offline in the arcades or in tournaments, so know one knows who he is in real life.

Some say he's a shut-in and he's too fat to get out of his room.
On the other hand, Sakuraba never plays online.
I wonder why?
So we don't actually know who's better between Morimiya and Sakuraba.
He was really excited yesterday because he thought he'd be able to fight Morimiya.
Sorry for not being the right Morimiya...
You're pretty amazing yourself!
Sakuraba wants a rematch with you even though you're a beginner!

He said you were good. He must have picked up on something that we didn't.
You better practice dilligently this week! We'll teach you!
Come on.
Let's go!
Ugh...
I got dragged into this again...
The most important thing you need to learn when you start out is
your bread and butter combos!
Bread and butter...?
Hey, wait!
You can't just tell a beginner to start learning combos! He needs to learn how to block first!

Wouldn't it be better to explain high, mid and low attacks first?
Backdashing is super important! If he doesn't learn how to defend, he'll get blown away! {assblasted :^)}
It's more important for him to find out how much fun cancelling is!
Hey, guys,
you're not helping him at all with all of those comments.
Fighting games are hard. I'm going to teach him on this basis so can you guys leave?
No, it would be pretty bad if you don't teach him this.
Nah, it's fine.
No, he needs to learn all of the optimal punishers!
Hahaha... {No text bubble next to his face}

Haah... {Tired sigh}
You're getting much better at moving your character around now!
Connecting all of the hits of your combos is fun, right?
Haha, yeah...
I wasn't even able to take one round, though... Haha...
Haah. {Disappointed sigh}
Your movement looks a little weird.
Huh?

!!?
Sakuraba! When did you get here?!
I just got here.
Did you hurt your left hand?
Huh...?
You can't move your fingers, right?

Huh?
Umm... Uhh...
Are you serious?
Hey.
Change your grip. Cover the ball with your hand.
Hold it lightly with your thumb and index and middle fingers. 
Yeah, like that.

Wow, it's so much more comfortable!

I can do better like this!
{>Still losing}
Uhh...
My left hand is really tired so I think I'll leave it at this for today.

If that's the case,
I'll move the joystick. You can press the buttons.
... What?
!!?
