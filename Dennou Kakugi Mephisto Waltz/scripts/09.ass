Chapter 9
The victor is decided in a flash!
Dennou Kakugi Mephisto Waltz
{Good luck figuring out where to FKU, maybe the black box?}

Shut up!
What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch?{make this page a gif and do a ticker of the whole copypasta :^)}
My brother could beat trash like you with one finger.
I'm not as good as him, so...

What?
Hey, come on.
I get that you're pissed but shouldn't you be challenging me?
scrape {or similar chair moving sound}

What?!
Seriously?
I'll take both of you on with five fingers each!

You're going to play with one hand?!
And both of us at the same time? Don't fuck with us!
As good as he is, there's no way he can play like that...
Asshole!
We'll destroy you!

You're kidding!
No way...
Sorry for the trouble. I'll head off.

U-Umm...
Hm?
Oh, it's you.
S-Sorry about those guys...
There's plenty of nice people at this arcade too! So, uhh, you know...
Would you come again?
Why?

You beat both of those guys with one hand each!
I've never seen anyone as good as you, other than Sakuraba...
So I kind of thought maybe we could play again...{gay af}
I-It was nothing!
Those guys were just trash so I knew exactly what they were going to do.
If it were against someone like you,
someone who could actually play, I wouldn't have stood a chance!{gaaaaay}

I'm not sure if he's complimenting me or making fun of me...
In any case, I came here to find good players to practice with.
It turned out Morimiya wasn't here,
so I don't have any more reason to come, do I?

I guess I wouldn't be good enough to practice with...
I'm still really bad... I've only been playing UA3 for two weeks...
You're playing like that after two weeks?

Huh?
Uhh...
Yeah... Sorry...
...
You need to practice more.

Aaahhh...
I still can't take a game off you, Aya-nee...
Well, that's because I'm the renowned Morimiya.
Maybe I'm not cut out for fighting games...
What?!
I've been playing for an entire two weeks,
but I still keep losing to everyone...
Minato was also really surprised when I told him today...
What's wrong, Aya-nee?

Don't laugh!
I'm actually kind of upset about this!
No, I wasn't laughing about that. Fran, you're actually—
Oh!
Mother is back!
Good games, Aya-nee! I'll see you tomorrow!

Welcome home, mother!
Oh, Fran! Did you have dinner at Mizuki's place?
Yeah.
I'd better go and thank her again then...
Phew.
Who would've thought Fran would get so hooked on a fighting game?

And he comes over every day to practice!
Aah, I'm so happy! ♥{not gay}
...

Considering he can play like that after only two weeks
It's no wonder Minato would be surprised...
