Dennou Kakugi Mephisto Waltz
A new series charges in!!

Chapter 8
Dennou Kakugi Mephisto Waltz
The battle begins on a new stage!!
{put in presented by FKU somewhere?}

I-I finally beat Takagi...
Whoa!
He turned the tables on me with just a pixel of health...
You've improved a lot, Fran!
Your combos and reaction blocking are already better than mine!
Your neutral is still terrible though!

Fran looks like he's having so much fun!
I never saw him smile this happily,
even when he won amazing awards at piano competitions.{help}
All right, who's next?
Let me take a break for a bit.
Argh, now I want to play!
But I can't because they'd find out that I'm Morimiya...

Is Morimiya here?
Huh?!
Are you Morimiya?
Huh? Uh... Yes.

Finally decided to show yourself offline?
I heard you had a FT7 with Sakuraba. I've been wanting to play you as well.

O-Oh wait, I'm not the Morimiya—
Huh?!

Hey, that's Minato Kitsukawa.
Kitsukawa?
He's the youngest player who made it into the 6th rank league last year.
Isn't he from Shinjuku?
They're starting!
You're Morimiya?

There's nothing special about you at all.
He's really good...
Round 2. Fight!
I need to counterattack, just once!

Now!
...!

That was close, but...
...this round is mine!

Your okizeme is weak!
...

Hey!
Are you really Morimiya?!
You don't even have the basics down!
Uh, I was going to say...
Blah blah blah{or something that sounds better}
...

Oh, sorry...
Your persona was exactly the same as what I saw online,
I thought it was you for sure.
I-It's okay, don't worry about it. I get it all the time.
The guys at the arcade I usually go to are too weak to even practice on.
But then I heard Morimiya showed up so I came to Ikebukuro to to check it out.
Are you trying to be a roaming samurai or something?

Shinjuku's players are trash.
Outta my way!
Hasn't that guy always been at the top in Shinjuku?
You know, Hayato Kitsukawa.
Ah yeah, that loser. No wonder there's only trash players in Shinjuku.
Oh, so Kitsukawa Minato is Kitsukawa Hayato's younger brother?
Now that you mention it, their power-focused playstyles are pretty similar.

Is that someone famous?
Yeah. Hayato is Minato's brother. He used to be Sakuraba's rival.
Sakuraba, the Lightning Emperor and Hayato, the Blazing Emperor. They were indisputably the strongest. No one could stand in their way.
This was during UA2, though.
Hayato stopped playing right as UA3 came out.

I bet it was because he couldn't keep up with the pace of UA3.
Yeah, Hayato was just an old geezer who beat some kids back in UA2 when there were no players.
Shut up.
◆ Trouble brews!
