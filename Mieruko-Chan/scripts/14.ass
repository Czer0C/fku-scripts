So majestic!{twitter caption}
Check it out!
Mieruko-chan
It's the photo we took at the shrine the other day!
Hehe
I got so many likes!
A photo filled with touchy subjects.

Oh, don't worry! I made sure to hide our faces with emojis!
Look!
Nah, it's not that...
No?
Don't worry.
This is the first time I've gotten so many likes!
sip
I guess normal people can't see them in photos either.
I'm so happy!
So y'know, I was thinking...
I might actually be a natural at photography!
Huh?
Tada! Check it out!
I got a polaroid camera!
The kind that prints out photos instantly!

I'm gonna take it to some nice-looking places,
take some nice-looking photos,
and make a really nice album!
...
No...
I can only see this becoming an encylopedia of nightmares...
Hana seems to be attracting them somehow...
So excited!
Wonder what I should shoot!
I have to be stern. This is for Hana's sake too.
Hana...
Listen,
your photos are great and all, but--
snap{or whatever camera shutter sound}
whirr
Why did you just take a photo?
You had a great expression!

Look!
I'm definitely a natural!
There's something passing by!
Yes... To capture photos is to capture passing moments of your life.
That was kinda deep. I'm actually impressed!
What an amazing photo!
I think you might be a natural at this!

Julia?
Isn't this the girl you bullied?
She's so cute!
Do you have to say it like that?
We were just messing around! Right, Miko?
!
Oh, what do we have here?
When did you two become such great pals?
You were just talking about finding some nice places to take photos, right?
I just so happen to know a place.
Oh, you do?
If you want, I can take you there next weekend.{I wish I was this smooth}
{Really? }Yeah, let's go!
Hana, wait... I don't think we should...

It would be a waste not to!
We have such a talented photographer capable of taking photos like this!
Julia!
You're such a good girl!
I'll do my best!
guh
I was trying to get her to stop...
I don't know the extent of your spiritual powers, Miko.
So I'm going to take the liberty of finding out.
I'll never forget that feeling of humiliation.
I'm Godmother's number one apprentice.
I'm going to make you recognize my powers!
...
Can't breathe...
Huh? What's wrong, Julia?!
...

Mount Spirit Bell Bus Stop{呼鈴山}
Saturday
Is there really a nice place to take photos around here?
Is this going to be okay?
It's just up ahead.
It kinda feels like a regular mountain.
Over there.
It's just through that tunnel.{Is this Spirited Away?}

Wh-What? W-We have to go through there?
It's so dark...
The scenery on the other side is really pretty!
This is place pretty infamous for being a gathering spot.
Someone that can see them will never want to go through.
Now, show me what you're made of!
Oh, there's a rock in my shoe.

Why is it so dark in the middle of the day?!
Do we really really have to go through there?
click
She threw something?!
It kind of looked like a rock...
Is this some sort of ritual?
Oops, lost my balance...
pat
!
clap clap
!{make this one bigger than the last one I guess}

It's a barrier!
She's setting up a barrier!
Why is she staring at me?
Did she see me fall over?
That was nothing.
Don't worry.
She set up that barrier in an instant!
"That was nothing"?
Is she flexing on me?

It's really dark and creepy in here... I have a bad feeling about this...
Sh-Should we head back?
Oh...
Yeah, good idea! No need to force ourselves just for some pictures.
Let's head back!
Hana, wait!
Are you really okay with that?
You're so talented.
Are you going to let a moment of fear make it go to waste?

A world of infinite possibilities awaits you just up ahead.
It'll be there on the other end of your camera lens!
More like a world of nightmares!
Infinite possibilities...
The world is waiting for me!
I won't run away!
Seriously?!
Nice try, but I'm not about to let you hide your powers from me.
Don't think you've won just because you put up a barrier!
Since we're here, why don't you take a photo of the tunnel too?
You could call it "The Light at the End of the Tunnel"!{lit. light in the darkness}
Wow, that sounds kinda cool!

Say cheese!
Wh-Why{ is it just} me?
snap
I dunno, it feels kinda artistic!
whirr
Yeah, very artistic.
Now then, how much longer are you going to try and hide them from me?
Show me the spiritual powers that sent Mother into retirement!

Super artistic!

Wait, were there always this many?
Your expression is great too, Miko!
I could probably make a poster out of this!
Hana's power is making this worse.
We'd better leave quickly...
Before anything else shows up.
clang

huff
puff{Looked around, but can't find anything that doesn't remind me of big bad wolf. I'd rather skip.}
Something showed up.
Chapter 14, part 2 on Friday 2nd of August!
