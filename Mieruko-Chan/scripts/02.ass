Mieruko-Chan
Chapter 2
Morning!
I should be safe at school?
ha...
Why am I suddenly able to see all of them?
Was gone by the morning.
I haven't seen any today...
Maybe I can't see them anymo—

Morning!
...
Don't scare me like that, Hana...
How did you know it was me?!
The softness...

Anyway what's up? You don't need to be that surprised.
It's nothing...
I'm not seeing anything.
Maybe it was just yesterday...
Hey Hana, this is the third floor, right?
Huh?
Of course.
Did you hit your head just now?

Morning.

What?
What is it?
Even I'd get a bit nervous if you stare at me that intimately.
We're totally making eye contact.
We're totally making eye contact.
I'm scared. I'm scared. I'm scared. I'm scared.
ee
Hey!
Heeey!
...
Morning...
...

Were you maybe...
About to confess your love to me?
Just kidding.
Hey Hana... Where can I buy a rosary?
A rosary?
Maybe at Don Qui?{walmart :^)
Why do you want a rosary?
I can totally still see them.

Did you see yesterday's Totally Freaky?
What's Totally Freaky?
It's about scary stories that really happened!
I watched it because Yokota-kun was on it but it was so scary.
Oh I saw that! The one with the chopped off head!{freshly beheaded thing}
That was so scary!{how the hell do high school girls talk}
And when they opened the locker...
Aahh!
...

Th-They said...
They said there was a chopped off head in the locker!
What kind of messed up show is that?
Is it okay to show that kind of stuff on TV?
BPO!{wtf?}
I dunno what to tell you...
You're pretty bad with these kinds of things, huh?
I don't get how anyone couldn't be bad with them!
I turned on the TV the other day and there just happened to be a scary scene!
It made me spit out the borscht I was eating for dinner!
Borscht...
I guess she won't be able to help me.

Hey... Can you open the locker for me?
Why?
There could be a head inside!
There isn't...
Please! I won't be able to change!
...
ha...{should be a "gulp"}

ta-da
See, there's nothi—

Thank goodness!

Thanks!
I'm glad to have a friend like you.
Yeah. Hurry up and change.
But you know, sometimes on TV they quickly open it and there's nothing inside,
then when they relax and turn around, there's a monster right behind them.
Do you know what I mean?
Totally.
I really wish they didn't do that stuff.
Huh?
I can't reach.

Do you mind grabbing my phone for me?
Just can't reach it.
Huh?
Sure.
It's fine.
Nothing will happen if I just pretend I can't se—

Ahh
Are you okay?
Feeling anemic?
thump thump
I really wish they didn't do that stuff.
Next chapter on Friday 7th of December!
