Close siblings with slightly different tastes.{title}
Shopping for a birthday present for Mom.
Are we getting that?
Hmm...
I wonder if this would look good on Mom...
What do you think, Kyousuke?
Looks fine to me.
But it'd be cooler if it had a lion on it or something.
Right, I shouldn't have asked.{alt: Right, sorry for asking.}

Would you like to try it on?
Huh? Oh...
It's not for me.
You're more or less the same size as Mom.
Why not just check it'll fit?
All right...
I'll wait here.

It's so cute how he's like a boyfriend.{"acting" not really good here because he's not doing it intentionally. maybe "looks like" or something?}
You must be very close with your sister,
to be going out shopping together.
Not really.{just meant to be a kind of brush off answer, not particularly negative}

It's our mom's birthday soon.
Oh!
You're buying a present for your mother? That's lovely!
I guess.{as above}
Are you done yet? Can I open the curtain?
No!
That was a quick response!{why are there words on her hair}{Do we need to shorten this?}
You're taking ages, Sis.
No I'm not.
Don't rush me.

Wow...

It looks wonderful
Ouch
The size... The size is perfect{first bit is repeated}
Wow...
You done?{lmao}{Based.}
Wow, it looks wonderful!
Oh, it looks pretty good on you too.
...
We'll take it.
Thank you very much!
I'm sure it will look great on your mother as well.

Could we pay, please?
I'll just wear it home.
What, why?
Isn't it for Mom?
Did she take a liking to it because her brother complimented her?
Omigosh, she's super cute too!
Not going back in there.
Thank you very much!
What are we gonna do about the dress?

Fine thanks, how are you?
Oh, not at all.

Oh no, I can't get up!
