{mask line on the right, just a sales thing}
{get godmother store sign from last chapter thanks}
Please!
I'm begging you!
Make me your apprentice!{make me?}
How many times do I have to tell you?
I'm not taking any apprentices.
Sigh...
Not like little kids have money anyway...
You're just a grade-schooler, aren't you?
I'm in high school, despite how I look.
Yeah, sure.
Here.
You can have this. Now run along.
This bracelet is imbued with powerful spiritual energy.
Wow!
Godmother is actually quite well-known in her line of work.

My name is Julia Niguredou.
This means I'm officially her apprentice now, right?
I possess a strange power.
I can see beings that aren't of this world.
That one doesn't look too dangerous.
I'll let it go this time.
They don't scare me. They've been around for as long as I can remember.{lit. they've been part of my world ever since I was old enough to be aware of my surroundings}

I alone have this special power.
I'm certain it was given to me for a reason.{lit. born with}
I might be able to become an exorcist or something.
I'll become the object of everyone's envy. My life is set!
What do you mean you can see ghosts and stuff?
What an attention seeker.
Gross!
But I need to work hard
until then.
Under the guidance of Godmother.{Alt: But I need to work hard|under the guidance of Godmother|until then.}

{grab this sign from last time too thanks}
Closed for good?!
Oh, Mother went back to the countryside.{if you're looking for her}
Wh-Why?!
She said she was forced to realize the limits of her power, or something.
No way... She was the most powerful medium I'd ever met...
Her final customers were two girls, if I remember correctly.
Oh,
it was those two.{What a coincidence.}{same}
Oh, the bracelet shop went out of business.
Looks like it...
!
They're from the class next-door!

Well, it's no surprise they shut down.
Those bracelets were pretty flimsy.
Wh-What did she just say?!{e-excuse me?}
Amateurs like them wouldn't understand how great Mother's holy bracelets are.
Her final customers were two girls, if I remember correctly.
She said she was forced to realize the limits of her power, or something.
What exactly did they do to Mother?{A stretch?}
Well whatever, let's hurry up and get some butt buns before we go home!
H-Hana, wait!
Hana!

There's a cockroach.
Eek!
Wh-Where?! D-Did I step on it?
Sorry, I think I imagined it.{misheard is a thing right? but mis-saw seems kinda weird idk}
C'mon, you scared me!
Sorry.
The pavement tricked me.
You freaked me out!
Wait...
Did she just make her friend avoid it?

Yeah, sorry.
I'll buy you two butt buns to make up for it.
THUMP{Keep it in the bubble}

Hey...
Do you... have a minute?
Sorry for getting you to help clean up.
I don't mind, it's no big deal.
She's from the class next-door, I think?

You're Miko, right?
Huh? Yeah.
I'm Julia.
Oh... Yeah, uh... Nice to meet you?
I've been watching you!
Uhh...
Huh?
I just happened to notice.
You're just like me.{gaaayyy}{one of us. one of us.}
...
Excuse me?
Rustle{No fullstop}

You can see them, right?
I've been observing her for a few days, and the way she ignores them is incredible.
I doubt I would have noticed if I couldn't see them too.
They like dark and damp places.
They also like to collect shiny things, so I scattered a bunch of bottlecaps around.
You haven't told anyone you can see them, have you?
I can understand why you wouldn't.

But don't worry, I'm the same as you.
Right now, it's just the two of us.
There's no need to hide your power.
Umm...
What are you talking about?
She's still trying to hide it?!
I-I'm saying you can see them!
Those!
Uhh... Cockroaches?
There's cockroaches in here?
Let's get out quickly!
N-No!
Who does she think she is?
She's powerful enough to drive Godmother to retirement, so someone as lowly as me isn't even worth talking to?
Is she saying...
That only she...
Should have this power?

Huh?
Huuh?
There's no way you can't see those!
Uh... Y-You mean...
The cockroaches?

How come this girl can see the tiny old guys,
but she can't see {\i1}that{\i0}?!
C-Calm down! Wh-What do I do?
Don't look down on my power!
Huh?
See?
Umm...
I'm not following...
There's no way this will end well if it finds out I can see it!{Missing I}
Fine, you leave me no choice!
I'm Mother's number one apprentice, Julia!
rattle
She who can drive away beings not of this world!

Can you see me?
Huh?
Huh?
Snarl{missed}
Oh no oh no oh no oh no
What am I gonna do... It's gonna find out!
What? Why did Mother's bracelet break?!
I won't be able to ward them off anymore!

But they-- 
ugh
guhh
Serpent Drop!
Anaguma! Anaguma!
!
There you go again, trying to scare me with these pranks!{missing comma}
You got me!
Sorry, this was the only thing that came to mind...
This is what happens to bad girls!
But.. I'm actually...
A real... powerful... medium...

Infirmary
Ngh...
Oh, you're awake.{/alive}
That's great.
Y-You murderer!
I didn't kill you.
Looks like this Julia girl wasn't able to see that massive one,
but she can still see them, just like I can.{Order here is incorrect. +prev 3}
This could be my chance.
I'll finally be able to confide in someone.
Would she listen, though? After I did all that to her...{missing ellipses}
H-Hey...

No, wait.
She couldn't see what I saw, so this might be a bad idea.
We made it out this time,
but who knows what could happen next time.
I don't know what's happening.
So I think it's best to pretend you can't see them.
Sorry for hurting you.
...

She's threatening me!{Move closer to Julia's face, fontsize up}
We made it out this time,
You made it out alive this time,
but who knows what could happen next time.
but you're dead next time.
So I think it's best to pretend you can't see them.
You better pretend you didn't see anything...
Sorry for hurting you.
If you don't want to get hurt.
Wonder if we'll ever be able to talk about all this.
Hey, did you really kill that girl from class 2? I heard you strangled her.
I didn't kill her.
This is so humiliating!
?
She's not going to get away with this!
She made an enemy.
Next chapter on Friday 28th of June!
