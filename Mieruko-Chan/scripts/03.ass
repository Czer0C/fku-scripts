Mieruko-Chan
Chapter 3
It feels a little breezy...
Hana's big blunder!
I think I might've accidentally taken my panties off when I changed.
Are you stupid?
You're so mean! That's bullying!
Oh no, they might still be in the locker room.
Not here...
Being with Hana really helps keep my mind off things.

I still see them around school sometimes.{I feel like this implies they're everywhere, when she's just saying they're here and there}
They aren't really doing anything to me though...
I just need to be careful not to react.
It'll be fine...
I'm gonna go back and look for them, wanna come with? //wow I'm such a good JK
Definitely not.
Well, whatevs.
I'm sure I'll be fine without them.
Will you?
I can just lay a handkerchief on my seat!
Why not just change into your gym uniform?

Hey, did you know MD's is having a half-price sale?
Yeah.
Sign: Mathematics I
Let's stop by on the way home.
Like //can we just remove this bubble {Is that necessary?}{The word or removing the bubble?}
I love their donuts.
You know that chewy one?
What was it called again?


Mon de ring!
Ugh.
Uugh...

You can't go wrong with a French Devil either.
...
...
Whoa, I'm kinda dizzy.
Huh? Anemia again?
Yeah. Anemia. Yeah.
Anyway, we gotta get out of here.
Come to the infirmary with me, Hana.

Patter. //stepping sound
You can lean on my shoulder until we get to the infirmary.
Uh... I'm good...
I couldn't get her away.

Weird, the nurse isn't here.
Don't worry, I'm fine now...
Anemia is serious stuff!
You could get really sick if you don't do something about it!
Right...
What should I do? I can't let that thing keep molesting Hana. //how to words
Hey, I found a stethoscope.

Hmm, I can't really hear my heartbeat.
Maybe it's all this fat in the way.
Hey, let me look for your heartbeat. //try and hear? or something idk
I bet I'll be able to hear it loud and clear!
What are you implying?
Now's not the time to be messing around...
Sign: Sanitizer
Sign: The flu is on the loose. Make sure to always keep your hands clean. //cut this off somewhere

Hana, did you know there's always heaps of germs on stethoscopes?
Wait, really?!
They get used on students with colds and stuff all the time.
Tell me that sooner!
Wanna use this hand sanitizer?
Definitely!
I don't know if this will do anything.
Maybe the alcohol in it will have some effect.
Give me your hands.
Here.
I'm doing this for your sake, Hana.

Squirt
Squirt
Aah!
Hey! Watch where you're spraying that!
It's so cold!
This is also for Hana's sake.
Stand still, you're making me miss...
...your hands.
Stop it!

Geez, I'm all wet now.
It's working?!
It's flailing about!
Maybe one of the chemicals hurts them!
If I can just make him leave with this...

Where's my sorry?
Sorry.
Something came out.

Well, I did get disinfected.
I forgive you!
I might've made things worse.
Sorry, Hana...
Let's disinfect the stethoscope too.
Now that it's all clean...
Let me examine you!
Uh... Please don't...
Come on, just for a bit!

Eeeek!
Is he going to molest me next?
Coming in from below!
Ngh.
I'm scared... But he got even creepier because of me...
The least I could do is take her place!
Wow! Your heart is beating really fast!
Huh?

You two look like you're having fun.
Class has already started, you know.
Oh, Miss Kido!
We weren't skipping class!
I don't want to hear any excuses.
Huh?
Hurry back to class.

Boing.
Miss Kido was as sexy as ever! //like erotic and stuff I gues
I hear she uses perfume and stuff!
Cool.
Huh? Why are you so upset?
No reason... //maybe we should call her meinaiko-chan.. because she's flat.. haha..
Next chapter on Friday 21st of December!
Was exorcised by the perfume. //dispelled? idk
Note: Results may vary. //different monster dudes won't die to perfume
