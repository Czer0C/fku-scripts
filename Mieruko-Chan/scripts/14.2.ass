Mieruko-chan: Chapter 14, Part 2
A strange, polarizing mood.
Come on, let's get through this tunnel!
I feel like I'll be able to take even better photos outside!
It's too dangerous to stay in here!
Ha--

What Julia saw
Ha!{shit}
She exorcised it in an instant!
She didn't even use any tools... She just waved her hand!
Her powers are terrifying!
What's Julia doing?
Wait, can she see it?
wink
wink
If she can see it then even she would agree that we should turn back.
What is she trying to say?
"Now you show me your power"?
gulp

You're not the only medium...
What the heck is she doing?!
Damn...
I guess she can't see it.
What are you guys doing?
Let's go!
Cockroach
I can just direct Hana away from them...
A spider's--

!
What, a spider?!
Where?!
"Spider"?!
Is that a mass exorcism technique?
I can't even exorcise one of them...
Am I really that weak?
Huh?
It vanished?

Was that me?
Did I exorcise it?
Did you see that?!
stare
Did you see my power?!
Oh no...
You saw it right?
What I did just now?
Now she has no choice but to acknowledge my strength!
My powers are the real deal!{bit too lit for me but nothing better came to mind}{Sounds like something she'd say, anyway}

?!
Not good...
We need to run!
Huh?
What?
Hey!
Come on!
She said there's a spider!{lmao hana}

You can see me
saw see seeing seen
Huh?

I can't handle spiders!
Let's get out of here!{, Scoobs}
Y-Yeah...

Mount Spirit Bell Bus Stop
Man, I really wanted to see that place.
I'm sure I would've got some really nice photos.
Three times
What was that?
She just ended up putting me in my place.
My powers are nothing compared to hers...
...

Say cheese!
Don't look so down, you two!
We can take photos whenever we want!
ding
ding
I sent it to you guys!
Hahaha, everyone's making such weird faces!
...
I'm gonna make it my lockscreen wallpaper!
What an attention seeker.
Gross!

I'm kinda hungry now.
Let's go to MD's!
RUMBLE
That was loud...
Well, no use worrying about it.
I'm safe for now.
Yeah, MD's sounds good.
What's your favourite MD's donut, Julia?
Th-The mushroom muffin...
Hahaha, that's so you!
Set as wallpaper
Stop it...
She set it as her wallpaper.
Next chapter on the 16th of August!
