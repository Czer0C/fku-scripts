Really?
The dark past of a certain young man.
That's almost a perfect score!
I can't believe it!
...
Can I go and play?
Explain yourself.

Why are there two points missing?
Tell me.
I'm not mad.
I'm just amazed that you would get this question wrong.
You should have been able to get full marks! I can't believe it.
I'm sorry.
I didn't ask for an apology.
I asked why you got this question wrong.
Tell me.

Are you done yet?
We're gonna be late for the birthday party!
Hmm?
What's this?
You didn't tell me about this.
Whose birthday party are you going to?
Ryota's...
Who is that? I've never met him.
What a despicable child, hiding things from your mother.
I-I wasn't hiding it!
I can't believe I raised such a terrible child!
Mom, please!
I used my allowance to buy him a present...
I promise I'll try harder on the next test...
Okay.
You can go.
!

You can go—if you want to be the kind of person who breaks their promises with me and betrays me and hurts me, just like your father!{Preferred punctuation for manga? Em-dash or semi-colon?}
Go and enjoy yourself!
The choice is yours.
So choose.

Sorry...
I don't think I can make it.
Correct!
Good job, Zen. {whoa}
Don't play with those boys anymore.
Okay?

I finished reading, sir.
Okay. The girl behind you can read next.
He doesn't even care!
He's not even trying to remember our names.
And then the man—

Sorry Hana, I've got plans today.
Huh? You got a boyfriend?
She has a boyfriend?
Bye, Sir!
He goes home pretty early, huh?
Isn't that like, the work-life balance kinda thing?

{mask right}
I'm seeing more and more of them every day.
And it's clear that he's affecting Hana.
I have to do something about this.
I'm scared. I'm really scared...

But I have to do this for Hana!{Protecco-chan}
I can't stand the thought of her suffering!
I can't look his way.
That thing will see me.
gulp

I have to be careful to ignore it.
Otherwise I might use up my third chance.
They might be helping me now,
but what happens after that?
I can't be sure.
I have to get that teacher as far away from Hana as possible.
I need to follow him,
and find some sort of evidence,
but I can't let that thing see me.
squelch
squelch

I'll report him to the police as soon as I see him doing anything suspicious.
That way, he won't be able to come back to school.
I only have the power to see "them". I can't do anything more than that.
But I have to do something.
Something only I can do.

He keeps avoiding all of the crowds.

Don't!
Don't. {confirmed with ch4}
Oh.
I remember now.

You're the girl from back then.
The one at the park who wouldn't give me the cat.
DON'T LOOK
!

!
...
What are you doing here?
Did you follow me?
!
Sorry,
but could you hand me that cat?

Oh my god!
What am I doing?
If I'd just stayed hidden and reported him, they might've even caught him red-handed!
He would've been kicked out of school for sure!
{mask text on right pls}
But there's no way I could have just left this cat to die!

Aah!
Hey.
You still haven't answered any of my questions.

Why won't you give me the cat?
Explain yourself.
Wait...
Don't tell me...
Ah!
Come back!

Huh?
What?
A dull thud resounded. What came over the crazed young man?
