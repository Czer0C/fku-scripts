How to Raise a Cat {book sign}

I've exterminated that pest.
They'll come pick it up on garbage collection day. {the garbage men will come pick it up?}

You were hiding something from me again, weren't you?
That made me so sad.
You traitor.
You're the most important thing in the world to me. Everything I do is for your sake.
Promise me you'll always listen only to me, and that you'll treasure me as much as I treasure you.
Okay?
Zen?

It's not your fault.
No, it--
I jumped in front of the car of my own accord.
I had it coming.
Was the cat okay?
Yeah...

I'm keeping it at my place at the moment.
What do you eat?
Beef stir fry?
We can't feed it meat.
What about chocolate?
I don't think that works either.
We're looking after it for now.
Oh.
I see.
That's good to hear.
I was... I was worried that you were going to do something terrible to that cat...
You were?
Why is that?
I-It's hard to explain...

It really is hard to explain.
But then why? {as in why all of the past evidence etc. maybe "but it doesn't add up" or sth}
There's been some rather horrific animal abuse cases going on in my area lately.
I had my concerns that you might've been the culprit.
Huh?
The way you were following me around was very suspicious.
And you didn't give me the cat.
Now that I think about it, you act quite odd at school too.
You're strange.
That's so mean! But he's right!
So you were patrolling the area?
Is that why you kept going through all the back alleys?

Yeah. Not that I'm able to help at all.
So many have died... They grow sick and weak, and pass away so easily.
It's all starting...
...
To come together...
These must be the cats that he tried to save.
You should avoid social media if you're looking for someone to take care of the cat.
There are some unsavory folk out there.
Huh?
I know some people, so I could help get you in touch.
Are you referring to me, perhaps?

Just how many cats do you want to send to my veterinary clinic?
Huh, Zen?
...
Hi, Satoru.
H-Hello!
I never would've thought one of his students would come to visit him in hospital.
Have you known him long?

We've been friends since elementary school.
I'm surprised he has friends.
You're a lot harsher than you look.
Well, the truth of it is he isn't very interested in people.
I bet he doesn't even remember any of his students' names.
The fact that he got hit by a car to rescue a cat doesn't surprise me in the slightest!
Really?
I got a message from him not too long ago telling me one of the cats he picked up had given birth.
Hello.
meow
meow
He's not allowed to keep pets, so I was helping him sneak them out.
Oh, I'm the one that looks after all of them, by the way.

Why doesn't he keep a cat of his own?
It sounds like he loves them so much.
His late mother was a pretty strict person.
One day, she found the cat that he'd been secretly looking after.
She told him "it's your fault that it died".
But I'm pretty sure she did the deed.
What?

She was really frightening. It was much less "discipline" and more "controlling" if you ask me.
I remember she used to always tell me not to look or get lost.
DON'T LOOK {now I want to go back and change this to "stop looking" reeee.}
So that's what that was.
Even now, I think his mother is still weighing heavily on him.
DON'T LOOK
I'm sure rescuing cats is his own way of trying to move forward,
but it's pretty dangerous--as you just saw.

All I do is treat the cats that he picks up, and find them a new home.
...
Why do you do so much?
I just want to help a friend in need!
That's all there is to it!
I'm glad to have met someone like you, though.
Huh?

Now I know that he's actually communicating properly with his students!
He really isn't...
I hope that one day, he'll stop seeing cats as objects of atonement,
but instead as somewhere to direct his affection.
Both as a vet and as his friend.
Oh, don't tell him what we talked about, okay?
...
I'd be so embarrassed if he found out.
He's doing it for his friend.
Oops, my wife is calling!
I'd better get back to work!

Where did Satoru go?
He had to get back to work.
He said hi.
I see.
Well, like I said before.
If you're looking for someone to take care of the cat, then I'd trust Satoru's clinic--
Sir!

Get well soon.
When you get better, would you look after the cat?
DON'T LOOK
...
Wh-What?.
I-I can't...
This is my fault.
{breathe in sound}
It all happened because of my misunderstanding.
squeeze

But you really love cats.
Don't you?
DON'T LOOK
...
I don't...
It's nothing like that...

You do.
If you didn't, I don't think you would've sprung to help so quickly.
DON'T LOOK
...
Don't you think it's about time?
I think it is.
Just let him be free. {I think it's pretty unambiguous that she's actually talking to the ghost here}

Third time.
She willingly gave up her last safeguard.
