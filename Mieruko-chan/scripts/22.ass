How to Raise a Cat {book sign}

I've exterminated that pest.
It will be cleaned up on garbage collection day. {the garbage men will come pick it up?}

You were hiding something from me again, weren't you?
That really upset me.
You traitor.
You're the most important thing in the world to me. Everything I do is for you.
Promise you'll listen to no one but me, and that you'll treasure me as much as I treasure you.
Okay?
Zen?

It's not your fault.
No, it--
I jumped in front of the car of my own accord.
It was my doing.
Was the cat okay?
Yeah...

I'm keeping it at my house for now.
What do you eat?
Beef stir fry?
We can't feed it meat.
What about chocolate?
I don't think that works either.
We're looking after it for the time being.
Oh.
I see.
That's good to hear.
I was... I was worried that you were going to do something terrible to it...
You were?
Why is that?
I-It's hard to explain...

It really is hard to explain.
But this doesn't add up. {as in why all of the past evidence etc. maybe "but it doesn't add up" or sth}
There's been some rather horrific animal abuse cases in my area lately.
I had my concerns that you might've been the culprit.
Huh?
The way you were following me around was very suspicious.
And you didn't give me that cat the other time.
Now that I think about it, you act quite odd at school too.
You're strange.
That's so mean! But he's right!
So you were patrolling the area?
Is that why you kept going down back alleys?

Yeah. Not that I'm able to help at all.
So many have died... They grow sick and weak, and pass away so quickly.
It's all... {Merge with 65 on right, if you can, Varric}
...
Starting to come together...
These must be the cats he's tried to save.
You should avoid social media if you're looking for someone to take care of the cat.
There are some unsavory folk out there.
Huh?
I know someone who could help, so you should get in touch with them.
Are you referring to me, perhaps?

Just how many cats do you want to send to my veterinary clinic?
Huh, Zen?
...
Hi, Satoru.
H-Hello!
I never would've thought one of his students would come to visit him in hospital.
Have you known him long?

We've been friends since elementary school.
I'm surprised he has friends.
You're harsher than you look.
Well, the truth of it is he isn't very interested in people.
I bet he doesn't even remember any of his students' names.
The fact that he got hit by a car to rescue a cat doesn't surprise me in the slightest!
Really?
I got a message from him not too long ago saying one of the cats he picked up had given birth.
Hello.
meow
meow
He's not allowed to keep pets, so I was helping him sneak them out.
Oh, I'm the one who looks after all of them, by the way.

Why doesn't he keep a cat of his own?
It sounds like he loves them a lot.
His late mother was a very strict person.
I'll change your bandage now, okay?
One day, she found the cat that he'd been secretly looking after.
She told him it was his fault that it died.
But I'm pretty sure she did the deed.
What?

She was really frightening. The things she did to him went far beyond what you'd call discipline, if you ask me.
I remember she would yell things like, "don't look" and "get lost".
DON'T LOOK
So that's what that was.
Even now, I think his mother still weighs heavily on him.
DON'T LOOK
I'm sure rescuing cats is his way of trying to move forward,
but it's pretty dangerous--as you just saw.

All I do is treat the cats that he picks up, and help find them a new home.
...
Why do you do so much?
I just want to help a friend in need!
That's all there is to it!
I'm glad we got to talk, though.
Huh?

Now I know he's actually communicating properly with his students!
He really isn't...
I hope that one day he'll stop seeing cats as a means of atonement,
and start seeing them as creatures to direct his affection towards.
This I hope as both a vet, and as his friend.
Oh, and don't tell him we spoke about this, okay?
...
I'd be so embarrassed if he found out.
He's doing it for his friend.
Oops, my wife is calling!
I'd better get back to work!

Where did Satoru go?
He had to get back to work.
He sends his regards.
I see.
Well, like I said before.
If you're looking for someone to take care of the cat, then I'd trust Satoru's clinic--
Sir!

I hope you get well soon,
then you can look after the cat once you're back at home.
DON'T LOOK
...
Wh-What?.
I-I can't...
This is my fault.
gulp
It all happened because of my misunderstanding.
squeeze

But you really love cats.
Don't you?
DON'T LOOK
...
I don't...
It's not like that...

You do.
If you didn't, I don't think you would have sprung to help so quickly.
DON'T LOOK
...
Isn't it about time?

Time for you
to let him be free. {I think it's pretty unambiguous that she's actually talking to the ghost here}

Third time.
She sacrificed her final safeguard.
