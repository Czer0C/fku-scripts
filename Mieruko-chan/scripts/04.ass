Man, there's so many people here...
Donuts for wellbeing. {title}
I guess everyone's after the half price deal.

Mieruko-Chan
Come on, Miko! We need to get in line before they all sell out!
Yeah, all right.

Put those negative thoughts aside.
We're here to enjoy some donuts.
What did they have here again?
tap {sfx}
The fungus muffin sounds pretty good.
I kinda want to try the giant scorpion choc chip too.
Oh, this looks kind of holy.
Amen Ring. {donut name}
$1 {:^)}
As delicious as it is bless— {maybe add an E and cut it off}
Where are you going, Miko?
The line's over here!

Huh?
This isn't
the right line.
What the heck are they lining up for?

You're always playing with your phone.
You need to watch where you're going!
You could walk into someone or get hit by a car.
I've seen people falling into holes too, you know!
Where's the menu... {small text on her head}
What if I hadn't called out to you?
You could've gotten seriously hurt!

Thanks, Hana.
Seriously, thank you.
I hope you don't do it again.
Don't ever get distracted by your phone.

I splurged and got ten mon de rings ♪
Are you going to eat them all by yourself?
Of course not! You can have one.
Did you know those have more than zero calories?
I {\i1}know{\i0}! I'm going to get even fatter!
I shouldn't have brought it up.
What did you get, Miko?
Three amen rings.
rustle {sfx}
Oh!

Poor thing.
Meow.
Meow. {sfx? maybe skip punctuation}
No dumping. {sign top left}
Did someone leave him here?
Omigosh he's adorable!
Look at him, he's so tiny!
...
Meow.
What's wrong, little kitty?
I'm always seeing creepy stuff.
meow {next to Hana}
Yeah. {next to Miko}
I could use some cuteness.

lick
lick {slurp sounds weird idk}
He's licking my finger! He's so cute, I can't take it!
Me neither.

I can't believe someone would just leave him here.
Maybe I should bring him home with me.
No.
No.
What do you think?
No.

Please retweet!
Look how cute this kitten is!
Come to ****** Park if you want to take him home.{Doing ** would be more English-y, right?}
We'll be here until the evening ☆
Sorry, I forgot I can't keep pets in my apartment.
I hope someone comes and gets him.
Yeah...
Is it following the cat?
Yeah, you're right. It'll be fine!
How could anyone say no to this cuteness?
We'd better be careful... {small text next to miko}

Ah!
I'm s—
Sorry...
...
...
Is he gonna kill me? Am I gonna die?
He's staring at us!
Uh, I don't think that's it.
Excuse me.
Are you the ones looking for someone to take care of the cat?

I was hoping you'd let me look after him.
Really? That's great!
Yeah, lucky I just happened to be passing by.
I'm so glad someone kind came to pick him up.
Don't.
We can't trust him.
What?

What's wrong?
I can't have him? {literally "you won't give him to me?" but it sounds a bit unnatural. current line isn't exactly the same tho, pls help}

kys {ghost left bubble. don't change this to *die*}{I wanna change it do die tbh}{but no one says that ;_;}
Are you sure about this?
Yes.
Probably.
Hey, he's still here...
Thank you, I'll take good care of him.

Are you sure about {\i1}this{\i0}?
