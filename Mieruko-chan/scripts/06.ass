Chapter 6
I bought some holy things.
These should keep me safe.
Probably...
She finally got them
Mieruko-Chan
Donqui really does have everything!
You bought another one of those plushies?
Don't you already have like a million of them?
It's cuter when there's more!
You can't talk, you bought four of those.
It's more effective when there's more...
Effective?{this is probably hana talking}

Are those holy bracelets trending or something?
Yeah, they are. Totally.
Really? I've never seen anyone else with them.
I'm a trendsetter.{lit. it's the most cutting-edge(?) trendy thing}
You mean they'll start becoming more popular?
Yeah... Definitely.
Maybe I should've bought some too.
Here.
Huh? For me?{you're giving these to me?}
Yeah.

Yay, thanks!{Going with cutesy rather than laughing}
We match now!
Beating the trends!{got in on the trend before it started}
Better increase Hana's defense stat as well.{should sound like an rpg thing}
I'll buy you a butt bun
to return the favor.
The heck is a butt bun?{same}
It's chewy and fluffy and delicious!
The store's just through here!{hana screams too much}
Uhh...{something like "oh shit" or "welp.."}

Come on, let's go!
Hana!
Wait!
rattle
!
H-Huh?
They're avoiding us?
Is this the power
of the bracelets?

There's a strawberry butt bun too.
Cool...{oh yeah...?}
They're actually staying away!
These bracelets are amazing!
Oh.
They only sell 50 strawberry ones each day.
This is all I needed.
We'd better hurry, before they run out!
I have nothing left to fe—

Miko? What's wrong?{what's up? what are you doing?}
Did your shoelaces come undone?

I'm—

I'm fine!{also illegal}{right bubble 1st panel}
My bracelet just snapped.{left bubble 1st panel}
What? You just bought it!{right bubble 2nd panel}
Stay back!{ts both lines}{text next to miko head 2nd panel}
I said stay back! Can he see me? He's going to notice me!{3rd panel top right}
What's going to happen if Hana runs into it?{3rd panel bottom right}
I'm scared I'm scared{3rd panel top left}
If I try to walk around it it will realize I can see it. What do I do?!{3rd panel bottom left}

I don't see
i—ahhhh!{I don't fucking know, her word becomes a scream}{This is definitely better than your ree.}
Wow.
Both of them broke!
Let's go back to Donqui and get them replaced!
It's fine...
haa
haa
But you just bought them!
Don't worry about it.

People that can't see them just go through them.
That was hard, but I'm okay now.
Oh, I dropped my plushie!
That was close, I didn't even realize I dropped it.
Wait!

Wow, you're quick.
I was about to leave it behind.
Yeah...
You're crying!
See, you're not fine at all!
I can't believe they sold you those defective bracelets.
I'm going to go back and complain.
Please don't...
After all that...
I won't let them get away with this!{with doing this to you}{lit. I feel bad for you}
The power of friendship.

Godmother of
Fortune Telling and Exorcism
Your luck with money, work, love
all raised to the max!{storefront sign}
You were spot on, Godmother!
Ever since I put on this bracelet,
men have been fawning over me like there's no tomorrow!
Hehe
If the power wears off, come again and I'll give you a new one for just 30,000 yen.
I'll definitely be back!

She'll probably only be back another two times at best.

If I subtract the amount I have to pay those guys to hit on Sakura,
I've barely made any profit.
one two three
I'd better find someone rich and stupid.
Ow, my back...

I'm not going to leech off you after trying for so long.
Excuse me.
Fortune Telling{sign}

Do you have a really powerful holy bracelet?
Something that won't break straight away!
My, what a pair of cuties.
Dammit, just a couple of brats...
You want a powerful holy bracelet? I just happen to have one that brings good luck.
I doubt these kids have any money.
I'll just sell them some old thing for 3,000 yen.
Here.
A great power resides within.{it's a lot more casual than this}
Wow, that looks kinda cool!
Can I try it on?
Of course!

It broke again!
...
Uhh...
I guess the band was old.{deteriorating}
Sorry, I'll get you a new one.
No, that's not it.
I may be rotten, but they don't call me the Godmother of Downtown for nothing.
I can barely make it out.
A black mist.

I can see it really clearly.
Why did it follow me?
Have you been seeing anything strange lately, young la—
Nope.
Has anything out of the ordinary happ—
Nope.
Huh? What are you guys talking about?!
Nothing.
She can see them, but she's completely ignoring them.
What a strong girl.

And this other girl...
Her life aura is incredible!
You're not talking about anything scary, right?
Yeah, she really is something...
It looks like she doesn't realize it herself, but it's probably attracting all sorts of things.
The same way the light of a blazing inferno attracts a moth.{idk about you but I think even moths stay away from blazing infernos}
I doubt anything I give her will have an effect with an aura that strong.

Umm... Could you get the bracelet?
O-Oh yeah.
Just give me a moment.
I don't sense anything paritcularly special about this girl.
But she's definitely a girl that sees "them."
Here it is.
I never thought I'd ever bring this out.

I'm not so rotten as to let a girl around the same age as my grandson go through something like this!
Don't worry, young lady.
It's been a long time
since I've felt this way.
The one from before is just a toy compared to this.
It's the most powerful item I have.
You don't have to pay, just take it.
It's filled with my power from back in my heyday.
My days of swindling end now!
The Godmother has returned!
reeee
reee
reeee

I guess the bracelets just break really easily.
Both of mine fell apart just now as well.
Yeah... You know, maybe I'm kind of done with them.
Yeah.
Let's get some butt buns and go home.
Yeah.
It went back to the alley.
Mom!
I'm a new woman.{left my old dirty self behind, like she stopped scamming people}
The Fortune Telling Mansion is closed for good.{end of business}

The Godmother was defeated with a single blow.
