You don't have to go in if you don't want to, Hana.
But...
Mieruko-chan
If I collect the stamp inside, {was gonna go with stamp rally but it's literally just one}
I can get 20 donuts for free! {all of hana's stuff here is the trembling font}
Congratulations.{no ! because it's meant to be deadpan done with life pumpkin man}
That was so scary!
I have to do it!
Next please.

Don't look.
...
Maybe doing stuff like this every now and then could help improve my mental fortitude. {I'm so jk 0w0}
Don't forget to collect your stamp.
I'm so scared!

What the heck? It's so real!
Sure is.
Hmph.
This place is a joke.
It's all just stupid tricks. This is nothing for people like us, who can see them.
Let's just go find that stamp and get our donuts.

Eek!
Aaaah!
Who's that?!
Aaaaah!!

That wasn't what I was expecting...
He was like Jason or something.
Like, an actual guy... {as opposed to a hologram or something}
Curses... {or some other ghostly angst}
This is way too scary!
Was this really set up by a donut store?

Hm, so this is what it's like.
It's not really the same kind of scary I normally deal with.
Aaaaaah!
Your screaming is startling me more than the monsters. {monsters? attractions? tricks? idk}
I can't help it!

You were fine in the Cursed Building, weren't you? Just think of this as the same thing.{Didn't capitalise this in 10, for the record}{Also I'd like to see this in final... Not sure if it's too wordy.}
That was just an abandoned building!
Did she say Cursed Building? The building that even mediums don't dare set foot inside?
And she said she was fine? Does that mean they went inside?!
Julia's imagination
She used Hana as bait to round them all up and take them out in one fell swoop!
Don't let go of my hand!
S-Sure...

What a fearsome duo...
Eek!
I think I heard something!
Wasn't that your stomach?
rustle
Huh?
W-Wait for me!
Aaaaah!

Aaaaah!
Aaaaah!
Aaaaah! {maybe use different fonts for these 3 or something}
Wait...

Nooo! Help me!
!
Oh, right. I don't have to pretend.
...
Aaaaah!
Aaaaah!
?

It's okay to scream!
Aaaaah!
I don't have to ignore them!
Sh-She's laughing!

Heeeelp!
This is actually...
Really refreshing!
Haa haa
Cursed Stamp {sign}
Now just stamp your card here. Then it will definitely be all over!{Bold/italic "definitely" to drive home that it ain't over.}
Hand in the card on your way out.
We made it...
Is this the right place?
Seems pretty sloppy compared to everything else...
I'm gonna stamp it, okay?

Hey.
Aa—
Hey, Miko
Do you think this is okay?
Nothing's gonna come out now that I've stamped it, right?
Hey.
...
Oh.

Hey.
Hey.
This is a real one.
Let's brace ourselves before we head back.
That was close.
Yeah.
Hey.
Hey.
It's following us!
...
What's wrong, Hana?

Aaaaah!
They're all here!

I really wish they didn't do this stuff!
guh
Run for the exit, Hana!
I've always had to grit my teeth and bear it.
{mask the one at the bottom tbh}
But now...
Miko?
Ge—
Get away from me!
...

They're not gonna listen to you!
We gotta run!
I said it!
Aaaaah!
I was finally able to say it!

Entrance Exit {left to right}
haa
haa
Congratulations, you made it.

Here you go.
20 free donuts.
{mask mrs donut I guess}
This is it...
I've found the meaning of life. {lit. the "weight" of life}
There's more to life than donuts.
The beaming face of utter satisfaction. {tagline on right}
I didn't really end up improving my mental fortitude, {I don't really want to use this phrasing twice}{Is fine}
but I feel great! {lit. relieved/refreshed}
I'm sure Julia would feel the same.
I'm never going back in there again...
Let's go to an actual haunted house next time! {actual as in not one run by a donut store}
Is she testing me or something?
Huh? O-Okay...
Relief.
