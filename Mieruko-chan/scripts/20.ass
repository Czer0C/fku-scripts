What approaches Hana, the hungry girl carried to the infirmary?

Infirmary
Excuse me.
Mieruko-chan
Oh, what's the matter? Not feeling well?
No, uh...
My...
M-My...
F—
Fr—
F—Fr—
Oh, you're here to visit?
Your friends are over there.

Friends...
Oh, Julia!
I saw you guys walking down the hallway before.
I'm so glad you came to see me!
Are you okay?
Well... You see...
She's just hungry.
It's probably because I skipped breakfunch.{it's a dumb made up word in the original too}
Breakfunch?
The meal between breakfast and brunch.

Oh, I have some mushroom candy if you want.
ruffle
Here.
Thank you...
roll
roll
I feel alive again...
You were _that_ hungry?
I can't believe I had to go to the infirmary because I was hungry!
Mr. Zen is going to think I'm a weirdo for sure!

Oh, you had _that_ teacher?
I'm not surprised you used up all of your life aura,
considering how many things he's possessed by.{this is a wordplay}
Life aura?
Oh shoot! Hana doesn't know about any of this!
Uh... No... Um... I mean,
If you're that tired, then you'd use up all your calories!{tired and possessed are homophones}
I'm feeling great now, thanks to your candy!
Y-Yay!
...
Oh no... She's giving me a death stare...
Hahaha...

Can she see it?{can she see the big one or can she just see all the smol ones}
Probably not.
It didn't sound like it from the way she said it.
Wait, Hana's life aura is getting used up?
I always thought she was just the kind of person that attracted them.
Is that what makes her hungry?
{skip the one on the left, merging with next}
Then, is _he_ the reason why Hana isn't feeling well?
{screechy cat noises from ch19}
W-Well, I'm glad to hear you're doing fi—

She's completely lost it!
I thought I covered it up pretty well!
What's wrong, Miko?{lit: your face looks scary}
Huh?
Oh, sorry.
Hey Julia, can we talk for a bit?
She might know something.

Serpent Drop
Anaguma!
Next time, you're dead.{check with prev}
S-Sorry, I need to get to my next class!{lit: I have to move classrooms next period (so I need to get ready)}
She left...
Here you go!
Wow!

Delicious!
You already had so much at lunch time...
Lunch time was ages ago!
Looks like Julia isn't going to come.
Want some?
I'm good.
What is that even?
It's so calm.

Just looking around like this, I can see.
They really are everywhere.
It's about to go inside that guy.
It really is peaceful.
Only if you can't see them.
I can't see life auras or anything,

but Hana's always been a big eater,
The texture on these is great!
well before I became able to see "them".{check consistent wording}
Am I rubbing off on her?{lit: is me being around causing them to approach her}
Even if I am, she's never gotten as ill as she did today.
I've just been ignoring it, thinking that the problem would fix itself eventually...
But maybe it won't...
Kids are so energetic!

You look kinda down today, Miko.
What's wrong?
Which one of us was sent to the infirmary again?
Come on, I'm fine now!
Kids really are energetic.
What am I even doing, getting _her_ worried about _me_?
I need to do something about this.{merge onto left I guess}

!

I love how innocent they are.

Three times.
Did that mean
I was given three chances?

They'll protect me three times?
And that was the second time?
That means...
I only have...
Rumble
Huh? But I just ate!
One more chance...
Use your lifelines wisely.
On to Hana's luncher.{after lunch meal}
