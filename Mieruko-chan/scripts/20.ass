What approaches the ravenous girl carried to the infirmary, Hana?{Thoughts on leaving out "Hana"?}

Infirmary
Excuse me.
Mieruko-chan
Oh, what's the matter? Not feeling well?
No, uh...
My...
M-My...
F—
Fr—
F—Fr—
Oh, you're here to visit?
Your friends are over there.

Friends...
Oh, Julia!
I saw you guys walking down the hallway before.
I'm so glad you came to see me!
Are you okay?
What happened?
Well... You see...
She's just hungry.
It's probably because I skipped breakfunch.{it's a dumb made up word in the original too}{Kinda 50-50 on it. Nothing coming to mind atm though}
Breakfunch?
The meal between breakfast and morning tea.

Oh, I have some mushroom candy if you want.
ruffle
Here.
Thank you...
roll
roll
I feel alive again...
You were _that_ hungry?
I can't believe I had to go to the infirmary because I was hungry!
Mr. Zen is going to think I'm a weirdo for sure!

Oh, you had _that_ teacher?
I'm not surprised you used up all your life aura,
considering how much he's being followed.{lit: how many things are possessing him}
Life aura?
Oh shoot! Hana doesn't know about any of this!
Uh, no... I mean...
It must be tiring, with everyone following him around! That would burn your calories for sure!{lit: "of course you'd lose all your calories if you're tired." tired and possessed are homophones.}
I'm feeling great now, thanks to your candy!
Y-Yay!
...
Oh no... She's glaring at me...
Hahaha...

Can she see the big one too?{can she see the big one or can she just see all the smol ones}
Probably not.
It didn't sound like it from the way she said it.
Wait, Hana's life aura is being sapped?
I always thought she was just someone who attracted them.
Is that what makes her hungry?
{skip the one on the left, merging with next}
Then, is _he_ the reason why Hana isn't feeling well?
SHH
SHH
GRRR
GRRR
W-Well, I'm glad to hear you're doing fi—

She's completely lost it!{This expression is used more for losing one's mind. Isn't she supposed to just be super angry?}
I thought I covered it up pretty well!
What's wrong, Miko?{lit: your face looks scary}{You're okay with leaving that out?}
Huh?
Oh, sorry.
Hey Julia, can we talk for a bit?
She might know something.

Serpent Drop
Anaguma!
But you're dead next time.
S-Sorry, I need to get to my next class!{lit: I have to move classrooms next period (so I need to get ready)}
She left...
Here you go!
Wow!

Delicious!
You already had so much at lunch time...
Lunch time was ages ago!
Looks like Julia isn't coming.
Want some?
I'm good.
What even is that?
It's so relaxing.

Just looking around like this,
I can see they really are everywhere.
It's about to go inside that guy.
It really is peaceful.
Only if you can't see them.
I can't see life auras or anything,

but Hana's always been a big eater,
These have a great texture!
way before I became able to see "them".
Am I rubbing off on her?{lit: is me being around causing them to approach her}
Even if I am, she's never gotten as ill as she did today.
I've just been ignoring it, thinking that the problem would fix itself eventually...
But maybe it won't...
Kids are so energetic!

You look kinda down today, Miko.
What's wrong?
Which of us was sent to the infirmary again?
Come on, I'm fine now!
I'm asking because I'm worried about you!
Haha, thanks. But I'm fine, really.
Kids really are energetic.
What am I even doing, getting _her_ worried about _me_?
I need to do something about this.{merge onto left I guess}

Huh?
Wait!

!

I love how innocent they are.

Three times.
Did that mean
I was given three chances?

They'll protect me three times?
And that was the second time?
That means...
I only have...
Rumble
Huh? But I just ate!
One more chance...
Use your lifelines wisely.
On to Hana's luncher.{after lunch meal}
