Kyousuke, the Chinese zodiac fanatic, kicks off the new year in a great mood.{tlc}
There sure are a lot of people around on new years.
Buttered Potatoes
Don't get lost, sis!
Yeah.
New Years.
Fried Noodles
Look!
They're doing a mochi pounding contest!
Mieruko-chan
I want some of that freshly-pounded mochi!
Ha Ha Ha Ha {this isn't laughing I think https://youtu.be/cGeUE9KK-es}

Wow, they're so good at it!
I can barely see what they're doing!
Oh, it's Hana.
Mochi...
Happy New Year!
She said "mochi"...
Happy New Year.
I don't think anyone else would've noticed that.
