Kyousuke kicks off the new year in high spirits, donning his Chinese zodiac sweater.
Sure are lots of people around on new years.

Don't get lost, sis!
Yeah.
New Years.

Look!
They're doing a mochi pounding contest!
Mieruko-chan
I want some of that freshly-pounded mochi!
Hah Hah Hah Hah {this isn't laughing I think https://youtu.be/cGeUE9KK-es}

Wow, they're so fast!
I can hardly see what they're doing!
Oh, it's Hana.
Mochi...
Happy New Year!
She said "mochi"...
Happy New Year.
I don't think anyone else would've noticed that.
