Cafeteria
Big Choc-Chip and Condensed Milk Yakisoba Bun - 300 Yen
Can I have three of these please?
They should call this violence against stomachs...
I've been starving all morning!
Didn't you eat a melon bun in homeroom?
That doesn't even count as eating!
It doesn't?
I have a big appetite in Fall!
You have a big appetite all-year round.

There's something about that new teacher...
I can't quite put my finger on it.
!
I swear I've seen him somewhere before.
You might be thinking of someone else.
Hmm, maybe.{she's not convinced}
Aah, I can't remember! I'm too hungry to think!
Maybe he wasn't as memorable for Hana because she can't see them.{how did we stylize this again}
Oh!
I forgot to buy another bun to snack on after lunch!
I really question your sanity sometimes.

Sorry, you head back first! I'll catch up!
Hey, waâ€”
Hana would probably get really worried if she remembered who he was.
MD's...
Voucher...
I'd better think of something to distract her with.
It's him...

Haa
Haa
Oh my god...
Haa
Haa
I'm going to have to ignore this every day?
I don't know if I can...

step step
step
No way!
He came after me?
step
step

Ahaha!
Like,
totally!
Phew.
Calm down.

Ugh.{see 84}
Crap.
I said that out loud.

Hmm?
Hmm?
Crap.
Hmm?
Crap!
Oh my god.
...
It's huge!
Hmm?
Hmm?

I messed up!
Hmm?
Hmm?
Hmm?
Hmm?

What do I do?
Hmm?
Hmm?
Hmm?
Ugh.
There's no toilet paper.{what a save lmao}
Oh well.
I suppose I'll have to use the next stall. {monotone font}
It's watching me!
I wonder if this one has toilet paper. {monotone font}

{LMAO}{ðŸ˜¢}

This bun isn't quite what I was expecting...
All the great flavors are clashing.
You're saying that on your third?
Do you want some, Julia?
I'm good.
I managed to make it out earlier thanks to Julia,
but I really have to get my act together.
I can't be on edge all the time, on top of dealing with everything I see around the school.

Do you always eat lunch there, Julia?{I'm not sure if she's intentionally not specifying because hana is around}
She didn't see the one back there.
...
What if I do?
Don't.
You shouldn't eat there anymore.
Then...
Where else am I supposed to eat?
Huh? Do you even have to ask?
You can just eat with us.
Here, have a cream bun.

It's a bun party!
It's...
It's not like I...{want to or anything!}{Let us know if this don't fit.}
Who would've thought he was a teacher
and would even become our class' homeroom teacher.
I hope nothing bad happens to anyone in the class.{trouble as in danger}
I can see them.{the ghosts; I was gonna reorder the lines but I feel like this line has to go in her eye}
I have to look out for everyone.{them as in her classmates}

DON'T LOOK

Simple really is best!
Huh?
What's wrong, Miko?
A beetle flew into my eye.
Isn't that like, really bad?!
A disturbing warning.{probably talking about the spider ghost}
Miko's day-to-day life gets kicked up a notch.{"goes up another level", "intensifies", etc. because she now has to ignore the big spider thing}
