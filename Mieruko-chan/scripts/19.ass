Oh!
Good morning, Zen!
I just happened to have made a little too much beef stew again! Silly me!
I brought some over for you, if you'd like.

Thank you very much.
What lies in the depths of the heart of an assaulted good samaritan?

These darned crows! I swear they've been multiplying.
They've been messing up all of the garbage!
The cats in the area used to keep them under control,
but I haven't seen many of them around lately.
Oh, did you hear?
They found another cat dead in the park, poor thing.
Eek!

...
What's the big idea? {damn crow... or whatever}
...
Thank you for the stew.
I'll wash the container and bring it back when I'm done.
What's wrong with your hand, Zen?
You're bleeding!

...
I dropped a glass.

Hey!
Stop spreading the trash everywhere!
This isn't a restaurant!
Get outta here!

Is it lunch time yet?
It's still second period.
Why are you looking at me like that? I can't help it! I was running late today so I only ate breakfast!
What does that even mean?

I've been kinda worried. Like, seriously.
I'm feeling really hungry these days.
...
Heh.
Hey!
Stop laughing!
You've always been a glutton, though.
Don't say that!
At least say I have a healthy appetite or something!
I'm seriously worried here!
Haha, sorry.
But, you know.
I love seeing you eating happily.

She loves me.
I sure do.
Don't drop the pace!
One more lap!
Hey Hana, let's race!
Running really helps get my mind off things.
You're going too fast, Miko!
You're gonna lose all of your calories!

you lose
Huh? What's wrong?
What about the race?
I changed my mind. Let's just run together.
Don't you think you're loving me a bit too much?
Yup, I sure do.

Third Period
All corpses were once living, breathing humans. They opened their mouths and outstretched their arms like dolls kneaded from dirt, to the extent where they began to doubt even reality, and lay limply on the ground, simply existing.{split this into 6 somehow thx}

Thank you, Yamada.
You can sit down.
I'm Morino!
You mixed up our names again!
You got it completely wrong!
Oh, sorry Morino.
Can't you remember your students' names yet?
Your memory is so bad!
Chie, didn't you say Mr Zen was totally your type?
Poor you!{.. he doesn't even remember your name!}
Please, _now_ he'll remember.{lit. just made him remember (because he forgot)}

DON'T LOOK
What do you even like about him?
His looks?
Suzuki, can you read the next part?
There's no one in our class called Suzuki!
This is the same one.
DON'T LOOK
The one from back then.
All right, how about...
Noda?
That's cheating, sir!
DON'T LOOK
Even after...
I doubt it knows that I can actually see it.
death, peasants will...
But that won't work...{will need to revisit these 3 lines}
