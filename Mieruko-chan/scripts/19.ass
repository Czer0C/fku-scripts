Oh!
Good morning, Zen!
I just happened to have made a little too much beef stew again! Silly me!
I brought some over for you, if you'd like.
...

Thank you.
What lies in the depths of the heart of an assaulted good samaritan? {TLC}

These darned crows! I swear they've been multiplying.
They've been making a mess of the garbage dump!
The cats in the area used to keep them under control,
but I haven't seen many of them around lately.
Oh, did you hear?
They found another dead cat in the park, poor thing.
Eek!

...
What's the big idea? {damn crow... or whatever}
...
Thank you for the stew.
I'll wash the container and bring it back when I'm done.
What happened to your hand, Zen?
You're bleeding!

...
I dropped a glass.

Hey!
Stop spreading the trash everywhere!
This isn't a restaurant!
Get outta here!

Is it lunch time yet?
It's still second period, Hana.
Why are you looking at me like that? I can't help it! I was running late today so I only ate breakfast!
What does that even mean?

I've been kinda worried lately. Like, seriously.
I'm always getting really hungry these days.
...
Heh.
Hey!
Stop laughing!
You've always been a glutton, though.
Don't say that!
At least say I have a healthy appetite or something!
I'm actually worried here!
Haha, sorry.
But, you know.
I love seeing you eating happily.

She loves me.
I sure do.
Don't drop the pace!
One more lap!
Hey Hana, let's race!
Running really helps get my mind off things.
You're going too fast, Miko!
You're gonna burn all your calories!{does this make more sense to be about miko or hana}

you lose
What's wrong?
What about the race?
I changed my mind. Let's just run together.
Don't you think you're a bit _too_ obsessed with me?
Yup, I sure am.

Third Period
The corpses wanted to prove that they were once living, breathing humans.
They opened their mouths and outstretched their arms,
like dolls kneaded from dirt,
to the extent where they began to doubt even reality,
and lay limply on the ground, scattered about
doing nothing more than simply existing.

Thank you, Miss Yamada.{thinking of going harry potter style here, i.e. teachers calling "mr. potter". hopefully it doesn't come bite us in the ass later}
You can sit down.
I'm Morino!
You mixed up our names again!
You weren't even close.
Oh, sorry Miss Morino.
You should remember your students' names already!
Your memory is so bad!
Chie, didn't you say you were totally into Mr Zen?
Poor you!{.. he doesn't even remember your name!}
Please, _now_ he'll remember.{lit. just made him remember (because he forgot)}

DON'T LOOK
What do you even like about him?
His looks?
Mister Suzuki, can you read the next part?
There's no one in our class called Suzuki!
This is the same one.
DON'T LOOK
It's one from back then.
All right, how about...
Miss Noda?
That's cheating, sir!
DON'T LOOK
Even after death...
It doesn't know that I can actually see it.
Peasants will...
Yet their hands...{this could go a lot of ways...}
It'll leave me alone if I ignore it.

But geez.
Grrr
Shh
Shh
Grrr
Grrr
There's even more than before.{talkin about the cat ghosts}
...
Miss Yotsuya, you're next.
It went inside him.
This reminds me of that time on the train.
aaargh
it hurrdszz
There was one that was inside a person.

I wonder if I can ask that guy for help...
that guy {sign bottom right}
FOUND YOU {next to his head}
No, what am I even thinking?
How would I even ask for a favor?
I don't know if I can trust that one either!
And anyway, that thing isn't even the main problem here.
Miss Yotsuya?
Yotsuya Miko. {real miko name hours pogg}
Huh?
Y-Yes?
Hi.
Could you read the next page?
Oh.

DON'T LOOK
The old woman...
!
No!
Within her right hand...
A flame was lit...
Don't cry! Don't cry!

The head of...
the body...
Bear it!
Don't let either of them catch on!{split into two left and right? or just keep it together?}
...
Is something the matt—
Oh no—
RUMBLE{or growl or grr or something maybe}

Sorry...
Umm...
I'm so hungry... I can't move...
May I go to the infirmary?
Guys, Hana said she's hungry!
Someone give her something to eat!
Are you okay, Hana?
Go get some rest! You need it!

clatter
I'll take her. To the infirmary.
Nice one, Miko!
Hang in there!
Make sure you fill her up!
Ugh...
Sorry, Miko.
I don't know what happened.
Once third period started, I suddenly started getting really hungry.

Hana...
Hm?
I love you...
You saved me.{tag on the left}
Huh? A-Am I gonna die?
No.
Savior.
?
Sorry for calling you a glutton.
