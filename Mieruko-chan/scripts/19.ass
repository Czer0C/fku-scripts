Oh!
Good morning, Zen!
I managed to make a little too much beef stew again! Silly me!
I brought some over for you, if you'd like.
...

Thank you.
What lies in the depths of an assaulted good Samaritan's heart? {TLC}

These darned crows! I swear they've been multiplying.
They've been making a mess of our garbage bags! {Are these called this in en-us?}
The cats in the area used to keep them under control,
but I haven't seen many around lately.
Oh, did you hear?
They found another dead cat in the park... Poor thing.
Eek!

...
Stupid crows... {damn crow... or whatever}
...
Thank you for the stew.
I'll wash the container and bring it back when I'm done.
What happened to your hand, Zen?
You're bleeding!

...
I dropped a glass.

Lost!

Hey!
Stop getting trash everywhere!
This isn't a restaurant!
Get outta here!

Is it lunch time yet?
It's still second period, Hana.
Why are you looking at me like that? I can't help it! I was running late today so I only ate breakfast!
What does that even mean?

I seriously don't know what's going on...
I'm just always hungry these days. {preggers}
...
Heh.
Hey!
Don't laugh!
You've always been a glutton, though.
Don't say it like that!
At least say I have a healthy appetite or something!
I'm actually worried here!
Haha, sorry.
But, you know.
I love seeing you eating happily.

She loves me.
I sure do. {Isn't this more dismissive? Like "Sure, sure."}
Don't drop the pace!
One more lap!
Hey Hana, let's race!
Running really helps get my mind off things.
You're going too fast, Miko!
You're gonna burn all your calories!{does this make more sense to be about miko or hana}{I'd say it's just something Hana thinks about}

you lose
What's wrong?
What about the race?
I changed my mind. Let's just run together.
Don't you think you're a bit _too_ obsessed with me?
Yup, I sure am.{As above.}

Third Period
The head remained there,{https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/flies/quotes/section/chapter-8/}
dim-eyed grinning faintly,
blood blackening between the teeth.
All at once they were running away,
as fast as they could,
through the forest toward the open beach.

Thank you, Miss Yamada.{thinking of going harry potter style here, i.e. teachers calling "mr. potter". hopefully it doesn't come bite us in the ass later}
You can sit down.
I'm Morino!
You keep messing up our names!
You weren't even close.
Oh, sorry Miss Morino.
You should have learned your students' names by now!
Your memory is so bad!
Chie, aren't you totally into Mr Zen?
Poor you!{.. he doesn't even remember your name!}
Please, _now_ he'll remember.{lit. just made him remember (because he forgot)}

DON'T LOOK
What do you even like about him?
His looks?
Mister Suzuki, can you read the next part?
There's no one in our class called Suzuki!
This is the same one.
DON'T LOOK
From the other day...
All right, how about...
Miss Noda?
That's cheating, sir!
DON'T LOOK
Away from the beast...{https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/flies/quotes/section/chapter-9/}
It doesn't know that I can actually see it.
Poor broken thing...
Harmless and horrible...
It'll leave me alone if I ignore it.

But geez.
Grrr
Shh
Shh
Grrr
Grrr
There's even more than before.{talkin about the cat ghosts}
...
Miss Yotsuya, you're next.
It went inside him.
This reminds me of that time on the train.
aaargh
it hurrdszz
There was one inside that person.

I wonder if I can ask that guy for help...
that guy {sign bottom right}
FOUND YOU {next to his head}
No, what am I thinking?
How would I even ask for a favor?
I don't know if I can trust it either!
And anyway, that thing isn't even the main problem here.
Miss Yotsuya?
Yotsuya Miko. {real miko name hours pogg}
Huh?
Y-Yes?
Hi.
Could you read the next page?
Oh.

DON'T LOOK
But the island...{https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/flies/quotes/section/chapter-12/}
!
No!
Scorched up...
Like dead wood...
Don't cry! Don't cry!

The head of...
the body...
Bear with it!
Don't let either of them catch on!{split into two left and right? or just keep it together?}{Reads better together}
...
Is something the matt—
Oh no—
RUMBLE{or growl or grr or something maybe}

Sorry...
Umm...
I'm so hungry... I can't move...
May I go to the infirmary?
Guys, Hana said she's hungry!
Someone give her something to eat!
Are you okay, Hana?
Go get some rest! You need it!

clatter
I'll take her. To the infirmary.
Nice one, Miko!
Hang in there!
Make sure you fill her up!{Er}
Ugh...
Sorry, Miko.
I don't know what happened.
Once third period started, I suddenly started getting really hungry.

Hana...
Hm?
I love you...
You saved me.{tag on the left}
Huh? A-Am I gonna die?
No.
Savior.
?
Sorry for calling you a glutton.
