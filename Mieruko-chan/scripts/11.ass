Chapter 11
You have reached your destination.
Route guidance complete.
We made it.
Huh?
Weren't we going to the movies?
Mieruko-chan
Oh, uhh... They were closed today.{Barric, gimme a font that looks monotone}
What?! Cinemas have closed days?!
Mikotani Shrine{? obfuscate between "mi" and "tani" at minimum}
Uh, yeah, of course.
Change of plans: no movie today{title}

Mikotani Shrine
So...
Why did we come to a shrine?
I thought it would be cool to walk around a holy place for a bit.
Wow that sounds super fun!
Anyway...
super holy places{ganglo search}

I have to do something about that creepy thing following Hana around.
It's so majestic!{I don't understand}
Is this place really gonna help? I kinda just followed the GPS.
Doesn't look like anyone's around, either.
Come on, Miko!
Guess we'll just have to check it out.

Is 5 yen all right for the offering? {as opposed to "enough" cause it's not strictly about amount imo}
...
Yeah, why not? {izumi posted ragrets on twitter saying you can't see that miko has a 500 yen clearly}{Barric, enhance.}{This is the best we'll get at this resolution.}

Please let many yummy things find their way into my belly.
Please do something about that creepy thing following Hana around.
Please help, I'll do anything to have that thing stop following her.
Please lift this curse from Hana. Also help me out, while you're at it.
...
...
She sure is taking her time...
All right... I don't know if this will help,
but I'm counting on you, spirits.{lit. I hope the blessing/grace etc of this holy area will help somehow}

Why are there more?!
That was a pretty long wish.
What exactly were you wishing for, Miko?
Good health.

I guess only an exorcism can help at this point.
This place sure has some nice vibes, though.
It feels like the kinda place you'd see in a Mhibli movie.
I was really looking forward to seeing
My Neighbor Troll 2 today. {idk how to split this across 2 bubbles}{tonari no totoro (totoro next to me) -> chikaba no tororu (nearby troll?)}
Come out, ash gremlins! {has anyone seen totoro}{Nope. "they are identified as "black soots" in early subtitles, as "soot sprites" or "dust bunnies" in the Streamline Pictures English dub,[1][2] and as "soot gremlins" in the Walt Disney Studios English dubbed version."} {Ash/dust goblins, or rice/matcha combinations.} {In the original, to scare them away, Satsuki and Mei shouted "Makkuro Kurosuke, come out! Or we'll poke your eyeballs out!". This doesn't sound politically correct today, so in the English dub, it was changed to "come out... come out...".}
Come out... Come out, or else!

What's your favourite Mhibli film
Miko? {idk how to put this in 2 bubbles either}{Just put Miko? in the second bubble.}
Princess Oboroge? {tl note: oboroge means faint (as in like a ghost). fwiw mononoke also means ghost}(I think this one is good since Princess is the key word.){princess duonoke :joyy:}
The Dog Returns? {neko no ongaeshi (the cat returns [a favour]) -> inu no baikaeshi (the dog returns [a punch] twice [as hard]}(The Dog Returns){"the cat returns" is the official name but he uses a different word}
Banished Away? {sen to chihiro no kamikakushi (sen and chihiro get spirited away) -> sen no rikyui no onigoroshi (sen no rikyuu kills a demon) see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sen_no_Riky%C5%AB}{Banished Away? Sounds less awkward and matches background/the act of killing demon plus still matches Spirited Away.}
I didn't see anything--
I mean, any of them...
Seriously?
You mean you've only seen My Visible Troll? {mitano tororu -> did you see that, troll? I don't fucking know}{I think it's another reference to Totoro... combined with Mieruko/Girl that sees them, so Girl that Sees Trolls? Mitano-Troll-chan? etc}
You're missing out! They're all so good!
O-Oh, really?
What's going on?
Is that creepy thing dying?

Are those things like
gods or something?
They might be saving us from that creepy thing...
G-Good luck!
You can do--
aaaahhh!{Barric, your call if you think this should be same side (one line) or not}
Uhh...
Hey, look at that!

The sun behind the torii is making a really cool effect!
It's super majestic! {in comparison to just being "so dignified" from before}(Now it's... or ...dignified now!)
I'm gonna get like a billion retweets!
Let's take a picture together!
A-Are we done for?

The sunlight is making this pretty hard...
Hm...
Maybe like this...
Huh?

rip {tearing sound onomatopoeia (probably)}
This angle looks pretty good!
What?
Say cheese!

Yeah, looks good!
Check it out! {here, check it out, etc}
It looks all mystical and stuff!
These holy places sure are great!
What the heck is that?{Barric, maybe emphasise "that" with a different font?}
I can't believe this is with no filter!
Did it just... eat it? Is this... a god?
Are we saved? What's going on? I'm scared...

Wh-What's happening?
Are they trying to tell me something?
Oh my god!
I'm so scared!
I can't move!

Three times. {o boy}
I feel like a huge weight has been lifted from my shoulders.
I'm glad we came here today!
Same.
It did something to me, but it's probably fine.
Next chapter on Friday 7th of June!



----

The "three times" at the end was left intentionally ambiguous by the author, but a bit of background knowledge can't hurt.

The "traditional" way to pray at a Shinto shrine is to bow three times, clap three times, then bow once more (though this varies by type of shrine, era, etc). This is abbreviated to two bows, two claps, one bow in almost every instance in recent years. Hence, it's possible the ghost may be saying something like "I'll help you/forgive your rudeness this time, but make sure to pay your respects properly (by bowing three times) next time".

This was my first thought, and doesn't contradict any of the panels. The two smaller ghosts bowed to the big one, and then they frantically try to signal to Miko. One is shaking its head and the other is bowing; "no bow". I'm reasonably confident that this is the intended interpretation, but nothing is difinitive and there's still some leeway for speculation.

There is also a saying that literally translates to "even a saint will only keep his composure up to three times", i.e. even the kindest person will get angry if they are repeatedly treated rudely. By this interpretation, the ghost might be saying "I'll only help you three (more) times". This ties in with the fact that Miko says "please" three times during her wish, implying he'll be taking his payment (her soul or something) once the three times are up; she said she'd "do anything".

In fact, it's not even clear that he's saying "three times". There are a number of other synonyms; "dispersal", in the sense of ghosts being exorcised (he just caused the ghost to disperse), "welcome (to my shrine)", or even "adjournment". Either way it's unclear and left as an exercise for the reader.
