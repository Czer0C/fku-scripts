A disturbing smile added to the mix on the way home from school.

Cafeteria
Big Choc-Chip and Condensed Milk Yakisoba Bun - 300 Yen
Can I have three of these please?
They should call this violence against stomachs...
I've been starving all morning!
Didn't you eat a melon bun during homeroom?
That doesn't even count as eating!
It doesn't?
I have a big appetite in Autumn!
You have a big appetite all-year round.

That new teacher though, there's something about him.
I can't quite remember.
!
I swear I've seen him before somewhere.
You might be thinking of someone else.
Hmm, maybe.{she's not convinced}
Aah, I can't remember! I'm too hungry to think!
Maybe he didn't leave much of a lasting impression on Hana because she can't see "them".{how did we stylize this again}
Oh!
I forgot to buy another bun to snack on after lunch!
I really question your sanity sometimes.

Sorry, you head back first! I'll catch up!
Hey, waâ€”
Hana would probably get really worried if she remembered who he was.
MD's...
Voucher...
I'd better think of something to distract her with.
It's him...

Haa
Haa
Oh my god...
Haa
Haa
I'm going to have to{ try and} ignore this every day?
I don't know if I can do it...

step step

No way!
He came after me?

Ahaha!
Like,
totally!
Phew.
Calm down.

Ugh.{see 84}
Oh shit.
I said that out loud.

Hmm?
Hmm?
Oh shit.
Hmm?
Oh shit!
Oh my god.
...
It's huge!
Hmm?
Hmm?

I fucked up!
Hmm?
Hmm?
Hmm?
Hmm?

What do I do?
Hmm?
Hmm?
Hmm?
Ugh.
There's no toilet paper.{what a save lmao}
Oh well.
I guess I'll have to use the next stall.
It's watching me!
I wonder if there's any toilet paper here.

{LMAO}

This bun isn't quite what I was expecting...
All the great flavors are duking it out.
Are you really making this observation after having already eaten two?
Do you want some, Julia?
I'm good.
I managed to make it out earlier thanks to Julia,
but I really have to get my act together.
I can't keep shivering in my boots on top of dealing with all of the ones creeping around the school.

Is that where you always eat lunch, Julia?{I'm not sure if she's intentionally not specifying because hana is around}
She didn't see the one back there.
...
What if I do?
Stop.
Don't eat in a place like that.
What?
Then where else am I supposed to eat?
Huh? Do you have to ask?
Why don't you just eat with us?
Here, have a cream bun.

It's a bun party today!

Who would've thought he was a teacher,
and he would become our class' homeroom teacher.
I hope none of my classmates get into trouble.{trouble as in danger}
I can see them.{the ghosts; I was gonna reorder the lines but I feel like this line has to go in her eye}
I have to watch out for them.{them as in her classmates}

DON'T LOOK

Simple really is best!
Huh?
What's wrong, Miko?
A beetle flew into my eye.
Isn't that like, really bad?!
A disturbing warning.{probably talking about the spider ghost}
Miko's daily monster-ignoring lifestyle exacerbates.{"goes up another level", "intensifies", etc. because she now has to ignore the big spider thing}
