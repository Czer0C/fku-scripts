Wow, it moved!
Volume 2 on sale from the 21st of October!
It's sqirming around inside your belly, Miss!
Hahaha, squirming?
I don't think that's the right word.
It's twisting around!
You're going on maternity leave tomorrow, right Miss?
Oh, will you miss me, Miko?
Maybe a little.
I'm really going to miss you!

Make sure you give birth to a healthy child, then come back quickly!
I'll hold them during class for you!
Oh, how thoughtful of you.
Will you change their daipers too?
Aw, do I have to?
You sure do!
What is that?

What?!
Hm? What's wrong?
Oh, uhh... It's nothing...
It went into her stomach...
What do I do?

I should tell her.
But what would I even say?
Thanks for the help Miko, I'll be fine from here.
O-Okay...
Don't start eating in first period once I'm gone, okay Hana?
I wont!
I'll hold off all the way until third period!
...
I can't...
Telling her would just make her worry.

Miss, wait!
Umm... Just...
Take care...
Going down stairs and stuff...
Hm? Where did that come from all of a sudden?
I'll be fine.
Don't carry anything heavy... And...
Please take care of yourself...
...
Thank you.

I'll be fine this time.
I just know it.
?
"This time"?
This is actually my second child.
What?!
My first never made it out into the world.
He was a boy.
So I'm going to cherish them twice as much...
to give them their brother's share as well.
It's really strange, though.

Somehow I get the feeling that everything will work out fine.
Oh my god!
I'm going to change all of their daipers after all!
Haha, thank you Hana.

What exactly is it
that I can see?
Why did I become able to see them?

What am I supposed to do?
I just don't know.

Should I try something different?
I could be more like Julia...
or the granny with the holy bracelets.
Maybe I should.

I need to stop ignoring them.

What am I even supposed to do?

I tried to buy a drink yesterday,
and there was a moth on the vending machine that was _THIS_ big!
It was right on the button too! Can you believe it?{2nd bit is the smol text}
Did you just press it anyway? Sounds like you really wanted that drink.
No way!
Wouldn't it, like, fly into my face if I tried to do something?
Let sleeping moths lie, right? I just bought a drink from the store!
...

Yeah, I guess you're right.
It's better to just ignore them, isn't it?
Yeah...
I'll do that too.
Thanks Hana.
Huh?
Oh, it's our new teacher!
Hi everyone! As you know, Miss Arai is now on maternity leave.
I'll be taking over as your new teacher.

My name is Touno Zen.
It's nice to meet you all.
What?
You won't give him to me?
This'll be good!
Wow, for real?
He's so dashing!
Thank god it's someone nice.{not some cranky old whatever}
Damn he's cute.

Huh?
I have a bad feeling about this.
Next time will be a manga article.{tlc}
