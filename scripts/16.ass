Wow, it moved!
Volume 2 on sale from the 21st of October!
{S}He's sqirming around inside your belly, Miss!
Hahaha, squirming?
I don't think that's the right word.
{S}He's twisting around!
You're going on maternity leave tomorrow, right Miss?
Oh, will you miss me, Miko?
Maybe a bit.
I'll miss you a lot!

Make sure you give birth to a healthy child, then come back quickly!
I'll hold him{/her} during class for you!
Oh, how thoughtful of you.
Will you change his{/her} daipers too?
Aw, do I have to?
You sure do!
What is that?

What?!
Hm? What's wrong?
Oh, uhh... It's nothing...
It went into Miss' stomach...
What do I do?

I should tell her.
But what would I even say?
Thanks for the help Miko, I'll be fine from here.
O-Okay...
Don't start eating from first period once I'm gone, okay Hana?
I wont!
I'll hold off all the way until second period!
...
There's no point.
Telling her would just make her worry.

Miss, wait!
Umm... Yeah...
Take care...
Going down stairs and stuff...
Hm? Where did that come from all of a sudden?
I'll be fine.
Don't carry anything heavy... And...
Please take care of yourself...
...
Thanks.

I'll be fine this time around.
I just feel like it will be.
?
"This time around"?
This is actually my second child.
What?!
The first never made it out into the world.
He was a boy.
I'm going to give this one all of my love and care.{I think go with "her" just to make it less confusing?}
To make up for his{/her} brother, as well.
It's really strange, though.

Somehow I get the feeling that everything will work out fine.
That's so sad!
I'm going to change all of her daipers after all!
Haha, thanks.

Why did I become able to see them?

What am I supposed to do?
I have no idea.

Should I try to face them properly?
Like Julia.
Or the granny with the holy bracelets.
Maybe I should.
I should face them, head-on.

I tried to buy a drink yesterday,
and there was a moth that was _THIS_ big on the vending machine!
It was right on the button too! Can you believe it?{2nd bit is the smol text}
Did you just press it anyway? Sounds like you really wanted that drink.
No way!
Wouldn't it like fly into my face if I tried to do something?
Let sleeping moths lie, right? I just bought a drink from the store!
...

Yeah, I think you're right.
It's better to just ignore them, right?
Yeah...
I'll do that too.
Thanks, Hana.
Huh?
Oh, it's our new teacher!
Hi everyone! I'm going to be your new teacher, starting from today, since Miss Arai has gone on maternity leave.{please split}

My name is Touno Zen.
Nice to meet you all.
What?{pls check prev ch for wording}
I can't have him?{here too}
This'll be good!
Wow, for real?
He's so fresh!
Thank god, it's someone nice.{not some cranky old whatever}
Yeah I'd tap that.

Huh?
I have a bad feeling about this.
Next time will be a manga article.{tlc}
